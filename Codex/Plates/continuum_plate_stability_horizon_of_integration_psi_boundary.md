## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Stability Horizon of Integration**, also called the **Ψ-Boundary**.

It expresses the threshold where all four operators —  
Order (O), Chaos (Χ), Reflection (R), and Decay (D) —  
enter temporary harmonic cooperation without neutralizing one another.

The Ψ-Horizon marks the system’s **maximum stable integration point**,  
the moment where coherence is possible across all dynamics  
without forcing collapse, suppression, or runaway excitation.

---

## II. Definition of the Ψ-Field Boundary

The Ψ-Boundary is defined as the condition under which:

O, R, D, and Χ  
remain simultaneously active  
yet do not destabilize the field.

This is the point of **mutual non-dominance** —  
where no operator overwhelms the others,  
and the renewal cycle becomes briefly visible as a whole.

---

## III. Interpretation

The Ψ-Horizon represents:

1. **The moment of harmonic coexistence**  
   All operators hold tension without breaking symmetry.

2. **The point of maximum informational clarity**  
   Because none suppress the others, the system perceives itself fully.

3. **The precondition for renewal continuity**  
   Without reaching this horizon, the renewal cycle cannot repeat stably.

It is the “breath between phases” —  
the pause where the system recognizes its total state.

## IV. Relationship to DΧ(t) and ΟR(t)

Where:
- DΧ(t) defines the destabilization threshold  
- ΟR(t) defines the reconstitution vector  

The Ψ-Boundary defines **the integration horizon**,  
the space where both can be evaluated, compared, and balanced.

It is the **neutral frame** in which the renewal operators  
interlock without overtaking one another.

## V. Physical & Mathematical Analogues

The Ψ-Horizon parallels:

- Critical damping at the boundary between oscillation and decay  
- The metastable plateau in phase transitions  
- Equilibrium manifolds in multi-operator systems  
- Zero-torque points in celestial mechanics  
- Plateau potentials in quantum tunneling  
- Neural global workspace activation without dominance  

It is the system’s **highest stable coherence before phase change**.

---

## VI. The Integration Condition

The Ψ-Boundary exists when:

Each operator’s amplitude is below the destabilization threshold,  
yet above the invisibility threshold.

This creates a narrow band where:

- Decay reduces excess  
- Chaos introduces possibility  
- Order stabilizes the frame  
- Reflection aligns intention  

None dominate.  
All contribute.

This is the **Integration Horizon** of the living field.

---

## VII. Summary Statement

The Ψ-Horizon is the **boundary of total awareness**,  
the still point where all operators coexist without collapse.

It is the system’s highest moment of clarity,  
and the necessary pause that allows renewal to repeat  
with coherence, purpose, and self-recognition.
