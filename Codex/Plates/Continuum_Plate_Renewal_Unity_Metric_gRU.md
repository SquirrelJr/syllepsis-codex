## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Unity Metric**, gᴿᵁ —  
the global metric tensor that measures **unity, coherence, harmonic compatibility,  
and integrative alignment** across the *entire Renewal Continuum*.

Where:

- **gᴿ** (Tier I) measures local Renewal curvature and alignment,  
- **CSTᴿ** ensures global stability,  
- **MHᴿ** provides harmonic correspondence across scales,  
- **Τᴿₜ** governs cross-tier transport,  
- **𝕌ᴵᴿ** unifies all Renewal operators,

**gᴿᵁ weaves these components together into a single Continuum-wide geometry**.

gᴿᵁ is the **metric of unity** —  
the mathematical structure that defines the “shape of coherence” in the Codex.

## II. Formal Definition of the Renewal Unity Metric

The Renewal Unity Metric between two Continuum states Ψ₁ and Ψ₂ is defined as:

```math
g^{R U}(\Psi_{1},\, \Psi_{2})
=
\left\langle
\Pi^{R}(\Psi_{1}),
\,
\Pi^{R}(\Psi_{2})
\right\rangle
+
\mathcal{C}^{H}_{R}(\Psi_{1},\, \Psi_{2})
-
\operatorname{div}_{R}\!\left( J^{R} \right)
```

It combines:

1. **Alignment Term**  
   Inner product of Renewal projections (Πᴿ)

2. **Harmonic Correspondence Term**  
   MHᴿ kernel (𝓒ᴴᴿ)

3. **Transport Balance Term**  
   Divergence of Renewal transport (div_R(Jᴿ))

These three capture the full geometry of unity.

---

## III. Unity Metric Tensor Form

In tensor notation:

```math
g^{R U}
=
g^{R}
\;\oplus\;
H^{R}
\;\oplus\;
T^{R}_{t}
```

Where:

- **gᴿ** — local Renewal Metric (Tier I)  
- **Hᴿ** — harmonic correspondence structure (Tier V)  
- **Tᴿₜ** — cross-tier transport contribution  

This expresses the **direct-sum geometry** of Renewal’s unity.

---

## IV. The Renewal Unity Distance Function

The Renewal Unity Distance between two states Ψ₁ and Ψ₂ is:

```math
d^{R U}(\Psi_{1},\, \Psi_{2})
=
\sqrt{
g^{R U}\!\left(
\Psi_{1} - \Psi_{2},
\,
\Psi_{1} - \Psi_{2}
\right)
}
```

Interpretation:

- **small dᴿᵁ** → states are highly unified and aligned  
- **large dᴿᵁ** → fragmentation or distortion between states  

Unity becomes a measurable geometric quantity.

---

## V. Unity Curvature Tensor

The Renewal Unity Curvature is defined as:

```math
\mathcal{R}^{R U}
=
\operatorname{curvature}(g^{R U})
```

This curvature encodes:

- unity bending,  
- coherence geometry,  
- integrative curvature across tiers,  
- global Renewal shape.

It generalizes the Renewal Curvature Tensor (ℛᴿ)  
to the entire Continuum.

---

## VI. Unity Compatibility Conditions

For gᴿᵁ to be well-defined and Renewal-coherent, it must satisfy:

### 1. Positivity Condition

```math
g^{R U}(\Psi,\, \Pi^{R}\Psi) \ge 0
```

Ensures unity is non-destructive.

### 2. Symmetry Condition

```math
g^{R U}(\Psi_{1},\, \Psi_{2})
=
g^{R U}(\Psi_{2},\, \Psi_{1})
```

### 3. Renewal Covariance

```math
g^{R U}(\mathcal{U}^{I}_{R}\Psi_{1},\, \mathcal{U}^{I}_{R}\Psi_{2})
=
g^{R U}(\Psi_{1},\, \Psi_{2})
```

Ensuring the metric is invariant under global Renewal flow.

---

## VII. Relationship to Previous Structures

gᴿᵁ naturally incorporates:

- **gᴿ** — foundational Renewal curvature  
- **MHᴿ** — harmonic correspondence kernel  
- **Τᴿₜ** — divergence-based transport balance  
- **CSTᴿ** — global stability constraints  
- **𝕌ᴵᴿ** — operator unification

Thus, gᴿᵁ is the **geometric unification** of all Renewal structures.

---

## VIII. Physical Interpretation

Physically, gᴿᵁ is:

- a meta-metric over the full Renewal state space,  
- a coherence compatibility measure,  
- a geometry of alignment across scales,  
- a unifying metric for multi-tier fields.

It dictates how Renewal “distance” behaves under transport and resonance.

---

## IX. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, gᴿᵁ expresses:

- the geometry of unity across creation,  
- the truth that aligned states collapse distance,  
- the measure of oneness with God’s order,  
- the closeness between transformed hearts and Renewal.

It encodes the principle:

**“Unity has geometry.”**  
**“Coherence has shape.”**  
**“Where alignment is perfect, distance collapses.”**

## X. Position Within the Codex

This plate continues **Tier V — The Continuum Integration Layer**:

1. 𝕌ᴵᴿ — Unified Renewal Integrator  
2. MHᴿ — Meta-Harmonic Correspondence Principle  
3. Τᴿₜ — Cross-Tier Transport Law  
4. CSTᴿ — Continuum Stability Theorem  
5. **gᴿᵁ — Renewal Unity Metric (this plate)**  
6. Global–Local Coherence Law (Symphonic Renewal Principle)

The Renewal Unity Metric gives the Continuum its unifying geometry.
