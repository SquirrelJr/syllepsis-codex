## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Integration Curvature Flow**, ℱᴿ_int —  
the dynamic law describing **how the global Renewal geometry evolves over time** under the influence of Renewal itself.

Where the Renewal Integration Metric (gᴿ_int) establishes the global Renewal geometry,  
ℱᴿ_int determines:

- how global distortion dissolves,  
- how coherence spreads through the manifold,  
- how compassion-driven smoothing reshapes geometry,  
- how decay-driven relaxation reduces chaotic curvature,  
- how reflection sharpens global alignment,  
- how the Renewal universe evolves toward harmony.

This is the Renewal counterpart to classical geometric flows like Ricci flow,  
but infused with Renewal’s ethical, harmonic, and restorative principles.

## II. Renewal Integration Curvature Flow Equation

The Renewal Integration Curvature Flow is defined as:

```math
\partial_{t} gᴿ_{int}
=
-2 \, ℛᴿ_{int}
\;+\;
Φᴿ_{correction}
```

where:

- **ℛᴿ_int** = Renewal Integration Curvature Tensor  
- **Φᴿ_correction** = Renewal Correction Potential derived from Reflection, Compassion, and Decay  

This equation expresses that global Renewal geometry evolves by:

- **subtracting curvature** (smoothing distortion),  
- **adding Renewal correction** (restorative influence).

---

## III. Renewal Harmonic Correction Flow

The Renewal Correction Potential incorporates harmonically aligned operators:

```math
Φᴿ_{correction}
=
Cᴿ \otimes Cᴿ
\;-\;
Dᴿ \otimes Χᴿ
\;+\;
Rᴿ \otimes Oᴿ
```

Interpretation:

- **Cᴿ ⊗ Cᴿ** → compassion-driven smoothing  
- **Dᴿ ⊗ Χᴿ** → decay dissolving chaotic gradients  
- **Rᴿ ⊗ Oᴿ** → reflection aligning structural order  

This is the Renewal analogue of restorative deformation.

## IV. Global Coherence Gradient Flow

Coherence acts as a global gradient guiding geometry:

```math
\partial_{t} gᴿ_{int}
\supset
- 
abla γᴿ_{global}
```

where **γᴿ_global** is the global coherence function from Tier II.

This term expresses:

- coherence flows into low-alignment regions  
- global Renewal harmonizes curvature inconsistencies  

---

## V. Renewal Integration Entropy

Define the Renewal Integration Entropy:

```math
Sᴿ_{int}
=
\int |ℛᴿ_{int}| \, dVᴿ
```

Its time evolution satisfies:

```math
rac{d Sᴿ_{int}}{dt}
\le
0
```

meaning:

- global distortion **never increases**,  
- Renewal geometry **naturally relaxes toward harmony**.

---

## VI. Fixed-Point Renewal Manifolds

The curvature flow stabilizes when:

```math
\partial_{t} gᴿ_{int} = 0
```

which implies:

```math
2 ℛᴿ_{int} = Φᴿ_{correction}
```

These fixed points correspond to:

- constant-coherence regions  
- compassion-balanced curvature  
- reflection-order symmetric manifolds  
- minimal-distortion domains  

They represent **globally harmonized Renewal structures**.

---

## VII. Physical Interpretation

ℱᴿ_int models:

- global smoothing of Renewal geometry  
- reduction of chaotic curvature  
- propagation of coherence across large scales  
- stabilization of multisystem Renewal structures  
- dynamic harmonization of the Renewal Continuum  

It is the Renewal universe “settling into” its natural harmonic configuration.

---

## VIII. Spiritual Interpretation

The Renewal Integration Curvature Flow expresses:

- the world bending toward harmony as compassion spreads,  
- distortion being dissolved through decay,  
- clarity spreading through reflection,  
- alignment deepening wherever truth is present,  
- global coherence increasing over time.

It is the geometric expression of the principle:

**“Renewal transforms the shape of the whole.”**

## IX. Position Within the Codex

This plate advances **Tier III — The Renewal Integration Layer**:

1. gᴿ_int — Renewal Integration Metric  
2. **ℱᴿ_int — Renewal Integration Curvature Flow (this plate)**  
3. Renewal Global Conservation Laws  
4. Renewal Boundary Integration Conditions  
5. Renewal Integration Potential (Φᴿ_int)  
6. Renewal Universal Alignment Principle

ℱᴿ_int is the dynamic law that drives the global Renewal manifold toward increasing harmony.
