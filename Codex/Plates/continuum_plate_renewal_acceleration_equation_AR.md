## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Renewal Acceleration**, A_R(t):  
the second kinematic operator of the living field.

Where:
- DΧ(t) defines the instability threshold  
- ΟR(t) defines coherent reconstitution  
- V_R(t) defines the rate of traversal between them  

A_R(t) defines **how quickly that rate itself changes** —  
the *curvature of renewal*.

This reveals whether the system is gaining momentum, slowing down,  
or experiencing oscillatory renewal.

---

## II. Definition of Renewal Acceleration

Renewal Acceleration is defined as:

```math
A_R(t) = dV_R(t) / dt
```

Expanding V_R(t) = (O + R) / (Χ − D),  
A_R(t) becomes the time derivative of the Renewal Velocity ratio.

Interpretation:

- Positive A_R(t): renewal momentum is increasing  
- Zero A_R(t): renewal proceeds steadily  
- Negative A_R(t): renewal is decelerating or reversing  

This equation introduces **curvature** into the Renewal Cycle.

## III. Expanded Form (Optional Explicit Expression)

If the operator functions vary with time, the expanded derivative is:

```math
A_R(t) = ( (O′ + R′)(Χ − D) − (O + R)(Χ′ − D′) ) / (Χ − D)²
```

Where primes denote time derivatives of the operators.

This form reveals:

- How shifts in Chaos or Decay slow the ascent  
- How increases in Order or Reflection accelerate renewal  
- How the denominator’s growth or shrinkage changes curvature  

---

## IV. Interpretation

A_R(t) measures how:

1. Stability gains momentum  
2. Reflection spreads through the lattice  
3. Chaos and decay lose influence over time  
4. Coherence “catches” and becomes self-sustaining  
5. Renewal becomes exponential or plateaued  

High positive A_R(t) is a **surge of renewal**.  
Negative A_R(t) indicates **drag, resistance, or relapse**.

---

## V. Relation to DΧ(t), ΟR(t), and V_R(t)

DΧ(t) = threshold  
ΟR(t) = reconstitution  
V_R(t) = rate  
A_R(t) = curvature

Combined, they form the **renewal motion quartet**.

A_R(t) reveals whether the cycle:

- builds speed (positive curvature)  
- stabilizes (zero curvature)  
- collapses (negative curvature)  

It is the *second-order stability law* of the Codex.

---

## VI. Stability Condition

Renewal Acceleration remains positive when:

```math
(O′ + R′)(Χ − D)  >  (O + R)(Χ′ − D′)
```

Equality produces zero curvature.  
Inequality reversal yields negative curvature.

This describes the **dynamic tipping point** of renewal motion.

---

## VII. Summary Statement

A_R(t) formalizes the **curvature of renewal**.  
It describes whether renewal is accelerating, steady, or decelerating,  
and reveals the deeper dynamical structure of the Renewal Cycle.

Where V_R(t) tells *how fast* renewal occurs,  
A_R(t) tells *how that speed changes over time*.
