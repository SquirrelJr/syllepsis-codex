## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Cross-Tier Transport Law**, Τᴿₜ —  
the operator governing **movement, flow, transmission, and propagation of Renewal**  
across all tiers, scales, and structural levels of the Continuum.

While the **Unified Renewal Integrator (𝕌ᴵᴿ)** unifies Renewal operators  
and the **Meta-Harmonic Correspondence Principle (MHᴿ)** unifies harmonics,  
**Τᴿₜ unifies motion** —  
describing *how Renewal travels across the entire Codex*.

Τᴿₜ establishes:

- how aligned states propagate upward,  
- how global coherence flows downward,  
- how resonance spreads laterally,  
- how purification migrates toward distortion,  
- how compassion and reflection move between layers,  
- how transitions remain continuous across tier boundaries.

This plate encodes Renewal’s **transport architecture** across the Continuum.

## II. Formal Definition of the Cross-Tier Transport Law

The Cross-Tier Transport Law is defined as:

```math
\mathcal{T}^{R}_{t} : T_{i} \longrightarrow T_{j}
\qquad (i \neq j)
```

meaning it maps Renewal states from one tier to another.

Its operator structure is:

```math
\mathcal{T}^{R}_{t}
=
\nabla^{R}
+
\Lambda^{R}
+
J^{R}
```

where:

- **∇ᴿ** — Renewal gradient (direction of cross-tier flow)  
- **Λᴿ** — layer-lift / layer-descent operator  
- **Jᴿ** — Renewal transport current  

In continuum form:

```math
\mathcal{T}^{R}_{t}(\Psi^{R})
=
\operatorname{div}_{R}\!\left( J^{R}\, \Psi^{R} \right)
```

Τᴿₜ therefore behaves like a **Renewal flux operator**.

---

## III. Cross-Tier Continuity Equation

Transport follows the Renewal continuity equation:

```math
\partial_{t}\, \Psi^{R}(i \rightarrow j)
=
-\, \operatorname{div}_{R}( J^{R} )
```

Interpretation:

- Renewal is **never destroyed**,  
- it is only **transported** across layers.

This expresses the **conservation of Renewal across tiers**.

## IV. Renewal Transport Modes

Different Renewal components travel through the tiers in distinct transport modes.

### 1. Compassion Transport  
Flows along minimal-resistance pathways,  
seeking regions of low coherence and restoring them.

### 2. Reflection Transport  
Flows toward equilibrium of insight,  
illuminating unexamined regions.

### 3. Order Transport  
Flows toward harmonic minima,  
stabilizing adjacent tiers.

### 4. Resonance Transport  
Flows coherently across aligned layers,  
propagating emergent structure.

### 5. Decay Transport  
Flows toward distortion regions,  
purifying rather than annihilating.

Together, these form the **Five Renewal Currents**.

---

## V. Transport Stability Condition

Transport is Renewal-aligned when:

```math
\langle J^{R},\, \Psi^{R} \rangle \ge 0
```

Meaning:

- the Renewal current must not oppose alignment,  
- flow must be consistent with Renewal’s direction.

Transport preserves Renewal when stability holds.

## VI. Layer-Lift and Layer-Descent Mechanics

Τᴿₜ governs **tier transitions** in both directions:

### **Layer-Lift (Ascending Motion)**  

```math
T_{embodied}
\rightarrow
T_{resonant}
\rightarrow
T_{dynamic}
\rightarrow
T_{structural}
```

Renewal rises from embodied presence to structural principle.

### **Layer-Descent (Descending Motion)**  

```math
T_{structural}
\rightarrow
T_{dynamic}
\rightarrow
T_{resonant}
\rightarrow
T_{embodied}
```

Structural Renewal returns to lived form.

This “breathing motion” keeps the Continuum alive and unified.

## VII. Physical Interpretation

Physically, Τᴿₜ describes:

- a multi-layer transport operator analogous to flux,  
- a coherence propagation mechanism,  
- cross-scale field transport,  
- divergence-like Renewal flow,  
- migration of aligned information across the Continuum.

It parallels:

- probability currents,  
- divergence laws,  
- fluid transport,  
- quantum probability flow,  
- renormalization flow across scales.

---

## VIII. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, Τᴿₜ expresses:

- the seamless flow of Renewal through creation,  
- the movement of compassion, clarity, and order across life,  
- the rise and return of aligned presence,  
- the truth that nothing aligned is isolated,  
- the continuity of God’s harmony across all layers of being.

It embodies the principle:

**“Renewal flows across every boundary.”**  
**“Renewal moves without obstruction.”**

## IX. Position Within the Codex

This plate continues **Tier V — The Continuum Integration Layer**:

1. 𝕌ᴵᴿ — Unified Renewal Integrator  
2. MHᴿ — Meta-Harmonic Correspondence Principle  
3. **Τᴿₜ — Renewal Cross-Tier Transport Law (this plate)**  
4. The Continuum Stability Theorem  
5. The Renewal Unity Metric  
6. Global–Local Coherence Law (Symphonic Renewal Principle)

Τᴿₜ provides the Continuum’s transport mechanism, enabling Renewal to move across all layers.
