## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces the **Renewal Field Metric**, g_R,  
the geometric structure that defines:

- distance between renewal states  
- curvature of the Renewal Field  
- how renewal “bends” under stabilizing and destabilizing forces  
- why some renewal paths are straight (geodesic)  
- why others curve, spiral, or collapse  

If the previous plate unified the field into a single object 𝓕_R,  
this plate defines **the geometry in which 𝓕_R lives**.

This is the Renewal Field’s analogue of a metric tensor.

---

## II. Definition of the Renewal Metric

The Renewal Metric g_R is defined as:

```math
g_R(𝓕_a,\ 𝓕_b) = Σ_{i=1}^{14} w_i \, 𝓡_{a,i} \, 𝓡_{b,i}
```

Where:

- 𝓕_a and 𝓕_b are two Renewal Field states  
- 𝓡_{i} are their operator components  
- w_i are metric weights (defined by operator significance)  

Interpretation:

- g_R > 0 → states are aligned  
- g_R = 0 → states are orthogonal / independent  
- g_R < 0 → states oppose or cancel  

This defines the **inner product** of the Renewal Field.

---

## III. Renewal Norm (Magnitude)

The magnitude of a Renewal Field state is:

```math
‖𝓕_R‖ = √{ g_R(𝓕_R,\ 𝓕_R) }
```

Meaning:

- high ‖𝓕_R‖ → strong renewal or strong distortion  
- low ‖𝓕_R‖ → weak contribution  
- zero → null renewal state  

This is the **size** of a renewal configuration.

---

## IV. Renewal Distance Between Field States

The Renewal Distance d_R between two states is:

```math
d_R(𝓕_a,\ 𝓕_b) = √{ g_R(𝓕_a - 𝓕_b,\ 𝓕_a - 𝓕_b) }
```

Meaning:

- small distance → easy transition  
- large distance → difficult transformation  
- infinite distance → incompatible renewal states  

This is the **geometry of renewal transition effort**.

---

## V. Renewal Curvature (Intrinsic Bending)

The Renewal Curvature scalar ℛ_R is defined via divergence of the metric:

```math
ℛ_R = ∇·( g_R^{-1} ∇g_R )
```

Interpretation:

- ℛ_R > 0 → constructive curvature (alignment, restoration)  
- ℛ_R = 0 → flat renewal geometry (neutral, easy flow)  
- ℛ_R < 0 → destructive curvature (traps, spirals, collapse)  

This is the **curvature signature** of a renewal environment.

---

## VI. Renewal Geodesics (Paths of Least Resistance)

A Renewal Geodesic γ(t) satisfies:

```math
∂²γ/∂t² + Γ_R(γ) = 0
```

Where Γ_R are “Renewal Christoffel Symbols”  
derived from the Renewal Metric.

Interpretation:

- straight-line renewal trajectories  
- natural growth paths  
- least-resistance recovery curves  
- minimal-harmonic-change pathways  

Geodesics describe the **natural renewal flow** in a given environment.

---

## VII. Metric Weight Structure

Weights w_i determine how strongly each operator influences geometry:

- w_ρ → sensitivity to density  
- w_V, w_A, w_J, w_S → kinematic importance  
- w_div, w_curl, w_lap → geometric influence  
- w_E, w_P → energetic influence  
- w_O, w_R, w_D, w_Χ → stabilizing/destabilizing balance  

General constraint:

```math
w_O,\ w_R > 0,\quad w_D,\ w_Χ < 0
```

- stabilizing operators **raise** metric coherence  
- destabilizing operators **lower** it  

This yields the **moral geometry** of the field.

---

## VIII. Renewal Metric Stability Condition

Stability requires the metric to remain positive-definite:

```math
g_R(𝓕_R,\ 𝓕_R) > 0
```

Violation implies:

- collapse  
- runaway resonance  
- destructive spirals  
- incoherent geometry  

Balanced geometry produces **smooth renewal dynamics**.

---

## IX. Interpretation

The Renewal Field Metric explains:

1. Why renewal is easier in some environments  
2. Why some transitions require little effort and others are massive  
3. Why distortions create geometric “pits” or traps  
4. Why coherence creates smooth pathways  
5. How spiritual or moral distortions change the “shape” of renewal  
6. How collapse spirals form curvature singularities  
7. How geodesic trajectories define optimal restoration  
8. How O/R and D/Χ warp the geometry of the field  

g_R is the **shape of renewal itself**.

---

## X. Summary Statement

The Renewal Field Metric establishes the **geometry**  
in which all Renewal Field operators live.

Where the previous plate unified all components into 𝓕_R,  
this plate defines:

- distance  
- curvature  
- alignment  
- geodesics  
- metric weighting  
- stability  

revealing the full **geometric foundation** of the Renewal Cycle.
