## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate inaugurates **Tier III — The Renewal Integration Layer** by defining the  
**Renewal Integration Metric**, gᴿ_int:  
the global geometric structure describing **how all Renewal systems combine into a unified Renewal manifold**.

Where earlier metrics (gᴿ) measured alignment within a single Renewal field,  
the Integration Metric measures alignment **across multiple interacting Renewal fields and systems**,  
capturing their collective harmony, coherence, and relational curvature.

gᴿ_int is the “macro-geometry” of the Renewal Continuum.

## II. Formal Definition of the Renewal Integration Metric

The Renewal Integration Metric incorporates contributions from:

- **local Renewal geometry** gᴿ  
- **coherence structures** γᴿ  
- **multisystem coupling** Mᴿ_sys  
- **harmonic global modes** Σᴿ  
- **integration coefficients** α₁, α₂, α₃  

It is defined as:

```math
gᴿ_{int}
=
gᴿ
+ α_{1} \, γᴿ_{AB}
+ α_{2} \, Mᴿ_{sys}
+ α_{3} \, Σᴿ_{global}
```

where:

- **gᴿ** = Renewal Metric from Tier I  
- **γᴿ_AB** = Renewal coherence between systems A and B  
- **Mᴿ_sys** = multisystem Renewal coupling integral  
- **Σᴿ_global** = long-range/global Renewal harmonic spectrum  
- **αᵢ** = Integration Weight Coefficients governing global influence

This structure unifies all Renewal subsystems into a coherent global geometry.

## III. Renewal Integration Curvature

From the Integration Metric comes the Integration Curvature Tensor:

```math
ℛᴿ_{int} =
ℛ(gᴿ_{int})
=
gᴿ_{int}{}^{-1}
\cdot
(∇ gᴿ_{int})
\cdot
(∇ gᴿ_{int})
```

This curvature describes:

- system-wide Renewal bending  
- global coherence gradients  
- large-scale Renewal distortions and corrections  
- harmonically induced macro-curvature  

High ℛᴿ_int indicates tension or misalignment across systems.  
Low ℛᴿ_int indicates widespread harmony.

---

## IV. Integration Lengthscale

The Renewal Integration Lengthscale is defined as:

```math
Lᴿ_{int}
=
rac{1}{\sqrt{|ℛᴿ_{int}|}}
```

This lengthscale represents the **reach of global Renewal coherence**:

- large Lᴿ_int → Renewal coherence spreads far  
- small Lᴿ_int → Renewal coherence is localized  

---

## V. Global Renewal Pathways

Paths that minimize gᴿ_int represent:

```math
δ \int gᴿ_{int} \, ds = 0
```

These are the **Renewal Integration Geodesics**, the global “least-distortion” pathways.

They represent:

- paths of highest alignment  
- channels of strongest Renewal  
- coherence-maximizing trajectories  
- macro-renewal flow lines  
- ethical/harmonic equilibrium routes  

---

## VI. Physical Interpretation

gᴿ_int models:

- global field structure of interacting Renewal systems  
- distributed Renewal curvature  
- coherence propagation landscapes  
- macroscale dynamics of compassion, reflection, decay, and order  
- the “shape” of an interconnected Renewal universe  

It is the Renewal analogue of a **cosmological metric** or **global relational manifold**.

---

## VII. Spiritual Interpretation

The Renewal Integration Metric expresses:

- how global harmony shapes the world  
- how aligned hearts and systems create clearer paths  
- how compassion ripples across boundaries  
- how shared reflection deepens clarity  
- how decay removes global distortion  
- how order establishes structural unity  

It is the geometric form of the principle:

**“When many systems resonate in Renewal, the world bends toward harmony.”**

## VIII. Position Within the Codex

This plate initiates the **Renewal Integration Layer — Tier III**:

1. **gᴿ_int — Renewal Integration Metric (this plate)**  
2. Renewal Integration Curvature Flow  
3. Renewal Global Conservation Laws  
4. Renewal Boundary Integration Conditions  
5. Renewal Integration Potential (Φᴿ_int)  
6. Renewal Universal Alignment Principle

Tier III integrates Renewal geometry, interactions, and harmonics into the full Renewal manifold.
