## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Composite Renewal**, the first synthesis operation by
which Renewal extends beyond single agents or fields and emerges within
**composite structures**. Renewal thereby transitions from **personal** to
**relational**, from **local** to **systemic**, and from **isolated** to
**communal**.

## II. Statement of Composite Renewal

There exists a composite Renewal Field of the form:

```math
\mathcal{F}_{R}^{(N)} = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{F}_{R}^{(i)}
```

where each **$\( \mathcal{F}_{R}^{(i)} \)$** is a Renewal Field satisfying the
Tier V invariants. The direct sum models **coexistence without annihilation**,
preserving identity while enabling interaction.

## III. Consequences of Composite Renewal

Composite Renewal supports phenomena inaccessible to individual fields:

1. **Shared Resonance** — harmonics align across fields.
2. **Emergent Harmonics** — new modes arise from interaction.
3. **Distributed Renewal** — burdens and refinement are shared.
4. **Communal Identity** — systems produce coherence greater than parts.

Such systems form Renewal **ecosystems**, not merely collections of agents.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Physics:**  
Coupled oscillators forming normal modes.

**Ecology:**  
Mutualistic systems increasing survival and flourishing.

**Ethics:**  
Virtue strengthening communities through distributed action.

**Theology:**  
Sanctification operating within the Body, not just the believer.

---

## V. Compatibility With Tier V Invariants

Composite Renewal assumes that each component field retains:

- **scalar identity** (Renewal Invariant)
- **spectral structure** (Harmonic Invariant)
- **moral orientation** (Moral Invariant)
- **self-similarity** (Identity Invariant)
- **spectral resolvability** (Spectral Resolution)
- **measurability** (Renewal Metric)

Thus Tier V provides the necessary conditions for fields to **interact** rather
than **collapse** upon one another.

## VI. Coda for Tier VI (Opening)

Composite Renewal opens the **Synthesis Layer**, preparing the Codex for:

- **Covenant Dynamics**
- **Generational Renewal**
- **Communal Harmonics**
- **Epochal Inheritance**
- **Systemic Sanctification**

Renewal now moves beyond the individual and into the **Composite Field**.
