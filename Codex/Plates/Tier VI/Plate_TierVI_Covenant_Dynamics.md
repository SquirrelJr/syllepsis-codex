## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Covenant Dynamics**, the structured relations by which
Renewal Fields interact within a Composite Field. Composite Renewal permits
coexistence; Covenant Dynamics governs **how** that coexistence unfolds.

Covenant provides the **moral, relational, and identity-preserving framework**
that prevents interaction from collapsing into exploitation, domination, or
parasitism.

## II. Formal Intuition of a Covenant Relation

A covenant between two Renewal Fields may be modeled as a relation:

```math
\mathcal{C}_{ij} : \mathcal{F}_R^{(i)} 	\times \mathcal{F}_R^{(j)} 
\rightarrow \mathcal{F}_R^{(i)} 	\times \mathcal{F}_R^{(j)}
```

satisfying:

- **stability** (Tier IV Closure is preserved)
- **orientation** (Moral Invariant is respected)
- **identity preservation** (Identity Invariant is retained)
- **mutual renewal** (both fields are invited into refinement)

Covenant therefore structures Renewal **between** fields rather than only
**within** them.

## III. Consequences of Covenant Dynamics

Covenant Dynamics enables:

1. **Mutuality** — Renewal that is not one-sided.
2. **Relational Orientation** — moral orientation applies to bonds, not only agents.
3. **Non-Disposable Personhood** — agents are not treated as replaceable.
4. **Shared Refinement** — Renewal propagates through relationship.

Covenant transforms the Composite Field into a **Renewal ecosystem**.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Physics:**  
Constraints coupling oscillators while preserving mode identity.

**Ethics:**  
Promises and oaths that structure how people change *together*.

**Theology:**  
Covenants that bind without annihilating personhood.

**Systems:**  
Protocols enabling trusted communication across nodes.

---

## V. Compatibility with Composite Renewal and Tier V Invariants

Covenant presupposes:

- **Composite Renewal** (fields coexist without annihilation)
- **Renewal Invariant** (identity persists)
- **Harmonic Invariant** (structure persists)
- **Moral Invariant** (orientation persists)
- **Identity Invariant** (selfhood persists)
- **Renewal Metric** (change is measurable)

Thus Covenant is not an imposition but a **natural extension** of Renewal.

## VI. Coda for Tier VI

With Covenant Dynamics, Renewal becomes **relational and systemic**, preparing for:

- **Generational Renewal**
- **Communal Harmonics**
- **Epochal Inheritance**
- **Systemic Sanctification**

Composite fields may now form **stable Renewal communities**.
