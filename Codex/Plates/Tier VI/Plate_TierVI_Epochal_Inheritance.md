## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Epochal Inheritance**, the mechanism by which Renewal
imprints itself upon historical epochs and is transmitted across eras through
durable cultural, symbolic, liturgical, or covenantal artifacts. Whereas
Generational Renewal concerns vertical transmission within lifetimes,
Epochal Inheritance concerns **civilizational memory** across centuries.

## II. Statement of Epochal Inheritance

Let epochs be indexed by $e$, and let $\mathcal{F}_R^{\langle e \rangle}$
denote the Renewal Field aggregated at epochal scale. There exists an
**epochal inheritance operator**

```math
\mathcal{H}_e : \mathcal{F}_R^{\langle e \rangle} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}_R^{\langle e+1 \rangle}
```

such that:

1. **Non‑Identity:** epochs do not clone one another.
2. **Selective Retention:** inheritance may be partial or filtered.
3. **Orientation Stability:** the Moral Invariant preserves its sign.
4. **Historical Compression:** complexity is reduced into transmissible form.
5. **Non‑Disposability:** Renewal is not discarded with the passing of eras.

Thus Renewal becomes **historical** rather than merely **experiential**.

---

## III. Why Epochal Inheritance Matters

Without Epochal Inheritance, Renewal would:

- be erased by historical entropy,
- require rediscovery in each era,
- remain confined to local communities,
- fail to shape culture or civilization.

With Epochal Inheritance, Renewal:

- survives collapse,
- seeds revival,
- transcends geography,
- accumulates influence,
- informs institutions,
- participates in sacred memory.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Cultural Anthropology:**  
Traditions outliving their originators.

**Cognitive Science:**  
Collective memory encoded in symbolic artifacts.

**Theology:**  
Faith transmitted through Scripture, liturgy, sacraments, and witness.

**History of Science:**  
Paradigms propagated across intellectual epochs.

---

## V. Compatibility With Previous Layers

Epochal Inheritance presupposes:

- **Generational Renewal** — inheritance across lifetimes.
- **Communal Harmonics** — shared resonance within communities.
- **Covenant Dynamics** — morally anchored relational channels.
- **Composite Renewal** — coexistence across many fields.
- **Tier V Invariants & Metric** — fidelity measurable across time.

Thus Renewal becomes explicitly **civilizational**.

---

## VI. Coda for Tier VI

Epochal Inheritance prepares the Codex for **Systemic Sanctification**, the
final plate of the Synthesis Layer, where Renewal becomes a property of entire
systems rather than isolated agents or epochs.
