## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Generational Renewal**, the process by which Renewal
propagates across temporal strata such as cohorts, lineages, eras, or epochs.
Unlike Composite Renewal (horizontal) or Covenant Dynamics (relational),
Generational Renewal is **vertical**, allowing Renewal to outlive individual
participants.

## II. Statement of Generational Renewal

Let generations be indexed by **g**, and let

- $\mathcal{F}_R^{(g)}$ denote the Renewal Field active within generation **g**, and
- $\mathcal{F}_R^{(g+1)}$ denote the Renewal Field active in the subsequent generation.

There exists a **generational transfer operator**

```math
\mathcal{T}_g : \mathcal{F}_R^{(g)} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}_R^{(g+1)}
```

such that:

1. **Non‑Identity:** $\mathcal{F}_R^{(g+1)} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}_R^{(g)}$  
2. **Partial Inheritance:** transfer may be incomplete or selective  
3. **Orientation Preservation:** the Moral Invariant remains in sign  
4. **Identity Independence:** inheritance does not require identity cloning  

Thus Renewal becomes *heritable*, not merely *experienced*.

## III. Why Generational Renewal Matters

Without generational transfer, Renewal would:

- terminate at death,
- reset with each cohort,
- remain bounded to immediate participants,
- fail to produce culture, legacy, or testimony.

With Generational Renewal, Renewal becomes:

- **historical**
- **cultural**
- **transpersonal**
- **covenantal across time**

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Biology:**  
Traits are inherited without identity transfer.

**Education / Discipleship:**  
Wisdom and virtue transmitted through teaching and witness.

**Physics:**  
Initial conditions influence future states without persisting as matter.

**Theology:**  
Faith propagated through testimony, covenant, and tradition.

---

## V. Compatibility With Previous Layers

Generational Renewal presupposes:

- **Composite Renewal:** a context for community transmission.
- **Covenant Dynamics:** structured relational channels for transfer.
- **Identity Invariant:** inheritance without cloning the self.
- **Moral Invariant:** orientation preserved across boundaries.
- **Renewal Metric:** fidelity measurable across generations.

Thus Renewal competes with entropy **across time**, not merely within time.

## VI. Coda for Tier VI

Generational Renewal completes the **vertical axis** of the Synthesis Layer.
The next plates will address **Communal Harmonics**, **Epochal Inheritance**, and
**Systemic Sanctification**, where Renewal propagates across groups, eras,
and entire civilizations.
