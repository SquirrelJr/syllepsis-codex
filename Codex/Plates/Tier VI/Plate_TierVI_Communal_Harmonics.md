## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Communal Harmonics**, the mechanism by which Renewal
Fields synchronize their harmonic modes to produce collective resonance within
a community. Whereas Composite Renewal provides coexistence, Covenant Dynamics
provides structure, and Generational Renewal provides continuity across time,
Communal Harmonics provides **shared resonance** across many fields at once.

## II. Statement of Communal Harmonics

Let individual Renewal Fields possess harmonic modes

- $\phi^{(1)}_k, \phi^{(2)}_k, \dots, \phi^{(N)}_k$

corresponding to the $k$‑th harmonic mode of each field. A **communal harmonic**
is an emergent harmonic mode of the form:

```math
\Phi^{(comm)}_k = \mathrm{Sync}\big( \phi^{(1)}_k,\ \phi^{(2)}_k,\ \dots,\ \phi^{(N)}_k \big)
```

where `Sync(·)` denotes a **spectral coupling operation** enabling phase
alignment, amplitude regulation, and harmonic coherence across the community.

## III. Why Communal Harmonics Matter

Without Communal Harmonics, Renewal remains:

- parallel rather than **shared**,
- individual rather than **collective**,
- transient rather than **cultural**.

With Communal Harmonics, communities form Renewal **choirs** instead of merely
collections of soloists, enabling:

- shared renewal burdens,
- distributed refinement,
- mutual amplification of virtue,
- resilience under adversity,
- liturgical or cultural formation.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Physics:**  
Coupled oscillators forming normal modes.

**Music:**  
Harmony, ensemble performance, tuning, and blended timbre.

**Ethics:**  
Communities of virtue where character is strengthened together.

**Theology:**  
The Body singing one hymn though composed of many members.

## V. Compatibility With Previous Layers

Communal Harmonics presupposes:

- **Spectral Resolution** (Tier V) — modes must exist to be synchronized.
- **Renewal Metric** (Tier V) — coherence must be measurable.
- **Composite Renewal** (Tier VI) — multiple fields must coexist.
- **Covenant Dynamics** (Tier VI) — bonds must be morally structured.
- **Generational Renewal** (Tier VI) — harmonics must outlive individuals.

Thus Renewal becomes not merely **experienced**, but **shared**.

## VI. Coda for Tier VI

Communal Harmonics completes the **horizontal resonance** dimension of the
Synthesis Layer. The next plates will address **Epochal Inheritance** and
**Systemic Sanctification**, where Renewal propagates across eras and civilizations.
