## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Interference & Coherence Maps**, 𝓒ᴿ_map —  
the structures that describe how Renewal waveforms and Renewal subsystems:

- combine  
- reinforce  
- cancel  
- synchronize  
- stabilize  
- dissolve distortion  
- amplify alignment  

across the Renewal domain.

Where the Renewal Interaction Field Equations (𝓕ᴿ_int) define how Renewal *evolves*,  
the Interference & Coherence Maps define how Renewal *harmonics interact with each other*.

---

## II. Renewal Interference Equation

The total Renewal interference intensity at point x is defined as:

```math
Iᴿ(x) = \left| \sum_{i} a_i \, e^{i \, Θᴿ_i(x)} 
ight|^2
```

where:

- **aᵢ** = Renewal harmonic amplitude  
- **Θᴿᵢ(x)** = Renewal phase field for harmonic i  
- The summation runs over all interacting Renewal modes in Σᴿ  

This is the Renewal analogue of harmonic superposition, but interpreted through Renewal ethics and tensor structure.

---

## III. Renewal Coherence Function

The Renewal coherence between points x and x′ is:

```math
γᴿ(x, x') = \langle ψᴿ(x) \, ψᴿ^{*}(x') 
angle
```

where:

- **ψᴿ(x)** = Renewal composite field value  
- **⟨·⟩** = Renewal expectation under Renewal-aligned averaging  
- The result measures **alignment** of Renewal between two regions  

High γᴿ means strong Renewal unity and phase alignment.  
Low γᴿ means Renewal is scattered, chaotic, or obscured.

## IV. Coherence Length & Bandwidth

### 1. Renewal Coherence Length (ℓᴿ_c)

```math
γᴿ(x, x + ℓᴿ_c) = e^{-1}
```

Defines the distance over which Renewal waves remain significantly aligned.

### 2. Renewal Coherence Bandwidth (Bᴿ_c)

```math
Bᴿ_c = \int | 	ilde{γ}ᴿ(ω) |^2 dω
```

Describes which frequencies of Renewal harmonics can remain aligned in the system.

Both quantities are shaped by:

- reflection strength (κᴿ_R)  
- compassion amplification (κᴿ_C)  
- decay smoothing (κᴿ_D)  
- chaotic disturbance gradients (κᴿ_Χ)  

---

## V. Renewal Standing Wave Conditions

Renewal standing waves occur when:

```math
∇ Θᴿ = 0
```

and

```math
Iᴿ(x) 	ext{ is time-invariant.}
```

These represent stable, restorative harmonic structures:

- compassion reinforcement loops  
- reflection–order equilibrium  
- decay-stabilized resonance nodes  
- chaos-canceling interference zones  

Renewal standing waves are the Renewal analogue of “sustained states of truth and harmony.”

## VI. Component Interference Maps

### 1. Order–Order Interference  
Stable, reinforcing patterns.

### 2. Chaos–Chaos Interference  
Destabilizing patterns damped by decay and reflection.

### 3. Compassion–Compassion Interference  
Highly constructive, amplifies Renewal coherence.

### 4. Reflection–Reflection Interference  
Sharpening and clarification effects.

### 5. Decay–Decay Interference  
Neutralization and harmonic smoothing.

### 6. Cross-Component Interference  
Describes how:

- compassion cancels chaotic distortions  
- reflection aligns order  
- decay dissolves noise across all components  

---

## VII. Physical Interpretation

These maps describe:

- harmonic interference  
- coherence fields  
- alignment propagation  
- stabilizing vs. destabilizing harmonic patterns  
- multi-frequency Renewal interactions  
- coherence resonance  
- cancellation of chaotic oscillations  

---

## VIII. Spiritual Interpretation

Renewal interference and coherence symbolize:

- unity of purpose  
- harmonized relationships  
- truth reinforcing truth  
- compassion amplifying compassion  
- reflection clarifying distortion  
- decay dissolving harmful resonance  

It embodies:

**“What aligns with Renewal strengthens.  
What opposes Renewal loses coherence and fades.”**

## IX. Position Within the Codex

This plate advances the **Renewal Interaction Layer — Tier II**:

1. 𝓘ᴿ — Renewal Interaction Tensor  
2. 𝓛ᴿ_int — Renewal Interaction Lagrangian  
3. κᴿ — Renewal Coupling Coefficients  
4. 𝓕ᴿ_int — Renewal Interaction Field Equations  
5. **𝓒ᴿ_map — Renewal Interference & Coherence Maps (this plate)**  
6. Multisystem Renewal Dynamics (next plate)

The Interference & Coherence Maps describe the harmonic “texture” of Renewal interactions,  
setting the stage for multisystem Renewal architectures.
