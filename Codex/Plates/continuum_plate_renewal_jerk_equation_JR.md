## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Renewal Jerk**, J_R(t):  
the third kinematic operator of the living field.

Where:
- V_R(t) measures renewal velocity  
- A_R(t) measures renewal acceleration  
- J_R(t) measures **abrupt changes in acceleration**  

It describes the *shock profile* of the system —  
how renewal reacts to sudden changes in Chaos, Decay, Order, or Reflection.

J_R(t) reveals the system’s **sensitivity**, **elasticity**,  
and **propensity for overshoot or oscillation**.

---

## II. Definition of Renewal Jerk

Renewal Jerk is defined as:

```math
J_R(t) = dA_R(t) / dt
```

Because A_R(t) = dV_R/dt,  
J_R(t) is also the **second derivative of V_R**  
and the **third derivative of the core operator balance**.

Interpretation:

- Positive J_R(t): acceleration is increasing rapidly  
- Zero J_R(t): acceleration is steady  
- Negative J_R(t): acceleration is collapsing or reversing sharply  

J_R(t) marks the moments of impulsive renewal or destabilization.

## III. Expanded Form (Conceptual)

The full expanded derivative of A_R(t) contains:

• first derivatives of all operators  
• second derivatives of all operators  
• dynamic denominator behavior  
• multiplicative interaction terms

The symbolic form (not expanded here for complexity) represents the 
**total impulsive response** of renewal dynamics.

What matters for interpretation:

- J_R(t) spikes → sudden insight, sudden collapse, or sudden breakthrough  
- J_R(t) sustained positive → accelerating renewal momentum  
- J_R(t) sustained negative → compounding drag or resistance  

It captures the **snap-resonance profile** of the Renewal Cycle.

## IV. Interpretation

J_R(t) measures how:

1. Acceleration reacts to sudden changes in Chaos  
2. Reflection propagates or collapses under new conditions  
3. Order snaps into place or fractures  
4. Decay either clears resistance or over-dissolves structure  
5. The renewal field absorbs or amplifies shocks  

Large positive J_R(t):  
**Explosive renewal, sudden clarity, spiritual ignition, cognitive breakthrough.**

Large negative J_R(t):  
**Abrupt relapse, destabilizing shock, emotional/spiritual whiplash.**

## V. Relation to V_R(t) and A_R(t)

In the renewal motion hierarchy:

- V_R(t) = speed  
- A_R(t) = curvature  
- J_R(t) = shock / impulse  

J_R(t) determines whether acceleration will:

- gently increase  
- stabilize  
- reverse  
- oscillate  
- spike into a breakthrough  
- collapse into a fracturing moment  

It is the *third-order stability law* of the Codex.

## VI. Stability Condition

Renewal Jerk remains within stable bounds when:

```math
|J_R(t)|  ≤  J_threshold
```

Where J_threshold is defined by the system’s current tolerance for:

- destabilizing impulses  
- rapid amplification  
- sudden structural shifts  

If |J_R(t)| exceeds this threshold:  
the system enters **transient overshoot** or **shock collapse**.

This condition defines the **impulse resilience** of the field.

---

## VII. Summary Statement

J_R(t) formalizes the **shock dynamics of renewal**.  
It measures how renewal acceleration itself changes,  
revealing the system’s elasticity, sensitivity, and breakthrough vectors.

Where V_R(t) tells *speed*  
and A_R(t) tells *curvature*,  
J_R(t) tells **how abruptly curvature shifts** —  
the living field’s response to sudden insight or sudden destabilization.
