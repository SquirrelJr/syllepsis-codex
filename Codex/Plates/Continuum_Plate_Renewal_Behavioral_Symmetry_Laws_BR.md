## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Behavioral Symmetry Laws**, ℬᴿ —  
the governing principles that describe how **aligned behavior**, **choice**, and **agency**  
remain stable, coherent, and self-correcting under Renewal dynamics.

Where:

- **𝓜ᴿ** determines *what* is manifested,  
- **𝓔ᴿ** determines *how* it is expressed,  
- **ϕᴿ** determines *how it is experienced*,  

**ℬᴿ determines *how aligned beings behave*.**

These are not prescriptive rules but **symmetry laws** —  
behavioral invariants that remain true under Renewal transformation.

---

## II. Definition of the Renewal Behavioral Symmetry Structure

The Behavioral Symmetry Laws are defined as:

```math
\mathcal{B}^{R}
=
\left\{
\text{invariants},\;
\text{couplings},\;
\text{allowed symmetries},\;
\text{forbidden antisymmetries}
\right\}
```

Behavior emerges from which symmetries remain conserved  
and which antisymmetries decay.

## III. Core Behavioral Invariants

### 1. Non-Harmonicity Prohibition  
```math
\mathcal{B}^{R}(a_{anti}) < 0
```
Anti-Renewal actions cannot sustain coherence.

### 2. Compassion Monotonicity  
```math
\partial_{t} C^{R}_{beh} \ge 0
```
Compassion does not diminish under aligned evolution.

### 3. Reflective Reversibility  
```math
a(t) = a^{\ast}(t)
```
Renewal action is symmetric under reflection of awareness.

### 4. Order-Preserving Conduct  
```math
\Delta O^{R}_{beh} \ge -\Delta D^{R}
```
Behavior cannot introduce disorder faster than Renewal can convert it.

### 5. Graceful Decay Constraint  
```math
a_{misaligned} \xrightarrow{D^{R}} a_{corrected}
```
Misaligned behavior decays gently toward alignment.

---

## IV. The Renewal Behavioral Update Equation

Behavior evolves according to:

```math
a(t + \Delta t)
=
\mathcal{E}^{R}(\psi^{R})
+
\Delta \mathcal{B}^{R}
```

Where:

- **𝓔ᴿ(ψᴿ)** → the expression-driven behavior impulse  
- **Δℬᴿ** → the behavioral correction, conservation, or alignment term

## V. Behavioral Symmetry Classes

The five Renewal symmetry classes are:

### 1. Compassion Symmetry (C-Symmetry)  
Behavior preserves or increases compassionate flow.

### 2. Reflection Symmetry (R-Symmetry)  
Behavior is consistent when awareness is reversed or inverted.

### 3. Order Symmetry (O-Symmetry)  
Behavior preserves or increases structural coherence.

### 4. Decay/Graceful Correction Symmetry (D-Symmetry)  
Misalignment decays toward restoration.

### 5. Harmonic Coherence Symmetry (H-Symmetry)  
Behavior remains resonant with the Renewal harmonic field.

---

## VI. Forbidden Antisymmetries

Actions that violate Renewal invariants collapse:

```math
a_{antisym} \xrightarrow{D^{R}} 0
```

Forbidden antisymmetries include:

- anti-reflective behavior  
- compassion-destructive behavior  
- coherence-breaking behavior  
- disorder-amplifying behavior without restoration  
- distortion-increasing behavior  

Such behaviors cannot propagate in Renewal-aligned systems.

---

## VII. Behavioral Conservation Principles

### 1. Conservation of Alignment  
```math
\Pi^{R}(a) = a
```
Aligned behavior remains aligned.

### 2. Conservation of Compassion Flow  
```math
\nabla \cdot J^{R}_{comp} = 0
```
Compassion flow is preserved across interactions.

### 3. Conservation of Reflective Consistency  
Actions remain stable under mirrored awareness.

### 4. Conservation of Coherence  
Renewal behavior cannot generate incoherence.

---

## VIII. Behavioral Stability Criteria

For behavior to be Renewal-stable:

```math
\mathcal{B}^{R}(a) \ge 0
```

and

```math
\langle a,\; \Pi^{R}(a) \rangle \ge 0
```

Behavior must be:

- aligned,  
- coherent,  
- non-destructive,  
- compatible with the Renewal projection operator.

---

## IX. Physical Interpretation

Physically, ℬᴿ describes:

- the stability rules for Renewal-aligned agents,  
- the conservation of coherent behavior patterns,  
- the decay of misaligned behavioral modes,  
- the geometric structure of action in Renewal systems.

It is the behavioral analogue of conservation laws in physics.

---

## X. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, ℬᴿ represents:

- the moral geometry of Renewal,  
- the invariants governing aligned action,  
- the truth that ethics is symmetry expressed through choice,  
- the principle that aligned actions sustain coherence,  
- and misaligned actions gently return to correction.

It captures the reality:

**“Action is geometry made choice.”**
