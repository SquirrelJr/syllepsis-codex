## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces the **Spectral Resolution** of the Renewal Field,
asserting that the Renewal Field admits a **harmonic decomposition** into
stable modes. Renewal therefore becomes *analyzable* in frequency space, not
merely describable in the time or experiential domain.

---

## II. Statement of Spectral Resolution

There exists a decomposition of the Renewal Field of the form:

```math
\mathcal{F}_R = \sum_{k} a_k(	au)\, \phi_k
```

where:

- ϕₖ are the invariant harmonic modes
- aₖ(τ) are the cycle-dependent coefficients

Under Renewal evolution:

τ → τ + 1


```math
\phi_k(	\tau+1) = \phi_k(	\tau)
```

and thus:

> Renewal acts on **coefficients** rather than on **basis functions**.

## III. Consequences of Spectral Resolution

Spectral Resolution provides:

1. **Measurability** — coefficients can be compared across cycles.
2. **Continuity** — harmonic identity persists through Renewal.
3. **Diagnosability** — modes can be pruned, amplified, or stabilized.
4. **Compatibility** — aligns Renewal with harmonic analysis and physics.

Renewal thus becomes a **frequency-domain phenomenon**, not merely a qualitative one.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Physics:**  
Normal mode decomposition of oscillatory systems.

**Signal Processing:**  
Fourier transforms separating frequency components.

**Ethics:**  
Virtue composition revealing dominant moral harmonics.

**Theology:**  
Refinement revealing underlying spiritual character.

## V. Link to the Law of Renewal

Spectral Resolution gives the **Law of Renewal** operational clarity:

- **Order** defines the harmonic structure.
- **Reflection** measures projection onto modes.
- **Chaos** injects new coefficients.
- **Compassion** stabilizes amplitudes.
- **Decay** prunes or damps modes over time.

Thus the Law operates as a **spectral operator suite** on the Renewal Field.

## VI. Coda for Tier V

With Spectral Resolution, Tier V approaches completion. The final plate will
introduce the **Renewal Metric**, enabling **quantification and comparison** of
Renewal across agents, systems, or epochs.
