## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces the **Renewal Invariant**, the fundamental scalar quantity
preserved under Renewal evolution. While the Renewal Field undergoes transport,
reflection, decay, and inversion, at least one scalar value persists unchanged,
ensuring identity across cycles.

## II. Statement of the Invariant

Let **𝓕_R** denote the Renewal Field under its operators. There exists a scalar
**I_R ∈ ℝ** such that for every Renewal cycle **τ**:

```math
I_R(τ + 1) = I_R(τ)
```

Equivalently:

> **Renewal preserves at least one quantity that defines identity across transformation.**

This Invariant may be represented as an integral, a conserved action, a mapping,
or a witness of continuity.

## III. Necessity of the Invariant

Without an invariant, Renewal would risk:

1. **Loss of Identity** — no persistence through renewal.
2. **Collapse into Noise** — transformations without continuity.
3. **Lack of Convergence** — no fixed reference for closure.

The existence of **I_R** ensures coherence across Renewal cycles.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Physical Analogy:**  
Energy or action preserved under evolution.

**Computational Analogy:**  
Halting truth value preserved through recursion.

**Ethical Analogy:**  
Moral consistency upheld through trial.

**Theological Analogy:**  
Faithfulness sustained through renewal.

---

## V. Compatibility With Tier IV Closure

Tier IV established that Renewal requires no added dimensions for closure.  
Tier V now asserts that closure contains at least one quantity that **survives**
the act of renewal itself.

Thus Renewal possesses both **sufficiency** and **continuity**.

## VI. Coda for Tier V (Opening)

The Renewal Invariant anchors Tier V, providing identity across cycles and
authorizing the introduction of higher-order invariants (harmonic, moral, and
spectral) in subsequent plates.
