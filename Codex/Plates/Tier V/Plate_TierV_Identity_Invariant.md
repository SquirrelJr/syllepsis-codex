## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces the **Identity Invariant**, asserting that Renewal preserves
recognizable **self-similarity** across cycles. Renewal refines identity rather
than replacing, annihilating, or cloning it.

---

## II. Statement of the Identity Invariant

There exists a mapping:

```math
\mathcal{I} : \mathcal{F}_R\Rightarrow \mathcal{F}_R 
```

such that under Renewal evolution:

```math
\mathcal{I}(	au+1) \simeq \mathcal{I}(	au)
```

where `\simeq` denotes **recognizable equivalence**, not equality. Equality would
imply stagnation; equivalence permits refinement, growth, and sanctification.

## III. Necessity of the Identity Invariant

Without an Identity Invariant, Renewal would reduce to:

1. **Substitution** — replacing the agent with a new one.
2. **Annihilation** — erasing uniqueness or agency.
3. **Cloning** — replication without continuity.
4. **Memory Loss** — transformation without selfhood.

The Identity Invariant ensures that Renewal protects **personal coherence**.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Biology:**  
An organism replaces its cells yet remains the same organism.

**Cognition:**  
Memory preserves the agent through time and learning.

**Ethics:**  
Virtue grows without erasing individuality.

**Theology:**  
Sanctification fulfills personhood rather than destroying it.

## V. Relation to Previous Invariants

Tier V now contains:

- **Renewal Invariant:** persistence of scalar identity  
- **Harmonic Invariant:** persistence of spectral structure  
- **Moral Invariant:** persistence of moral orientation  
- **Identity Invariant:** persistence of the *self* undergoing renewal  

Together they ensure Renewal is not merely mechanical, harmonic, or moral,
but **personal and continuous**.

## VI. Coda for Tier V

With the Identity Invariant, Tier V advances toward the **Spectral Resolution**
plate, where the Renewal Field will be decomposed into its harmonic components
via the Fourier Morality Field.
