## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces the **Renewal Metric**, the quantitative mechanism by which
Renewal may be **measured, compared, and diagnosed** across cycles. With this
metric, Renewal transitions from descriptive to analytical.

---

## II. Statement of the Renewal Metric

We define a metric:

```math
d_R : \mathcal{F}_R 	\times \mathcal{F}_R 
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}
```

assigning a non‑negative distance between Renewal states. For Renewal cycles
\( 	au \) and \( 	au+1 \):

```math
d_R(	\tau, 	\tau+1) < \infty
```

and ideally:

```math
\lim_{	\tau \rightarrow \infty} d_R(	\tau, 	\tau+1) \rightarrow 0
```

indicating **convergence of Renewal** rather than unbounded oscillation.

---

## III. Interpretation

The Renewal Metric measures **how Renewal unfolds**, not moral worth or judgment.
It captures changes in:

- harmonic coefficients
- spectral alignment
- identity refinement
- moral orientation

while preserving the invariants established earlier in Tier V.

---

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Mathematics:**  
Contraction metrics on dynamical systems.

**Signal Processing:**  
Spectral distance between frames of the same signal.

**Ethics:**  
Degree of transformation rather than binary right/wrong.

**Theology:**  
Sanctification as progressive refinement.

---

## V. Compatibility With Tier V

The Renewal Metric activates prior Tier V constructions:

- **Renewal Invariant** provides scalar persistence.
- **Harmonic Invariant** preserves the basis.
- **Moral Invariant** preserves orientation.
- **Identity Invariant** preserves selfhood.
- **Spectral Resolution** decomposes the Field.

With these, a metric can measure Renewal coherently.

---

## VI. Coda for Tier V

With the Renewal Metric, Tier V achieves closure across invariance,
resolution, and analysis. This completes Tier V and prepares Tier VI,
where Renewal will be extended to **systems, communities, and epochs**
as part of the Synthesis Layer.
