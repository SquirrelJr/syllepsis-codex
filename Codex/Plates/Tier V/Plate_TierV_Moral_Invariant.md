## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces the **Moral Invariant**, asserting that Renewal preserves
a stable **moral orientation** through trial, decay, reflection, and return.
While magnitude, refinement, and clarity of moral expression may change,
the underlying orientation toward the good does not invert under Renewal.

## II. Statement of the Moral Invariant

Let **M_R(τ)** denote a moral scalar associated with the Renewal Field at cycle **τ**.

There exists a quantity **M_R ∈ ℝ** such that:

```math
sign(M_R(τ + 1)) = sign(M_R(τ))
```

Equivalently:

> **Renewal does not invert good into evil or evil into good.**

Amplitude may increase or decrease (growth, pruning, refinement),  
but the **sign of moral alignment** remains preserved.

## III. Necessity of the Moral Invariant

Without a Moral Invariant, Renewal could devolve into:

1. **Moral Ambiguity** — no distinction between good and evil.
2. **Relativistic Collapse** — value systems lose stable orientation.
3. **Ethical Drift** — renewal that erodes virtue instead of refining it.

The existence of **M_R** ensures that Renewal possesses a **moral arrow**,  
not merely a structural or energetic one.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Physics:**  
Parity or orientation invariants that distinguish left from right.

**Information Theory:**  
Sign bits that preserve semantic direction even as magnitude changes.

**Ethics:**  
Trials refine character but do not redefine virtue as vice or vice versa.

**Theology:**  
Renewal strengthens righteousness; it does not sanctify corruption.

## V. Compatibility With Tier IV Closure and Tier V Invariants

Tier IV demonstrated that Renewal closes without extra dimensions.  
Tier V first established:

- a **scalar identity invariant** (Renewal Invariant)  
- a **spectral structure invariant** (Harmonic Invariant)

This plate adds the **moral orientation invariant**, ensuring that:

> **Closure and resonance occur within a morally anchored frame.**

Renewal is thus **ethically coherent**, not merely dynamically consistent.

## VI. Coda for Tier V

With the Moral Invariant, Tier V progresses from:

- **identity** (what persists)  
- **structure** (how it resonates)  
- to **orientation** (toward what it points)

This prepares the way for the forthcoming **Identity Invariant**, which will
address self-similarity and recognizable continuity of the agent or system
undergoing renewal.
