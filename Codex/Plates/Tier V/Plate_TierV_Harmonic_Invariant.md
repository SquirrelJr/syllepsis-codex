## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces the **Harmonic Invariant**, establishing that the Renewal
Field preserves a **stable harmonic basis** through the act of renewal. While
amplitudes, phases, and coefficients may vary across cycles, the **basis itself**
remains invariant.

## II. Statement of the Harmonic Invariant

Let **𝓕_R** be expanded in a harmonic basis:

```math
𝓕_R = Σ_k a_k · φ_k
```

Under Renewal evolution **τ → τ + 1**, the coefficients **a_k** may evolve,
but the functions **φ_k** remain fixed:

```math
φ_k(τ + 1) = φ_k(τ)
```

Equivalently:

> **Renewal preserves the harmonic modes of the Field.**

Thus, Renewal is not mere recycling but **structured resonance**.

## III. Distinction From the Renewal Invariant

- The **Renewal Invariant** preserves a **scalar identity**
- The **Harmonic Invariant** preserves a **spectral structure**

Identity requires a fixed value; resonance requires a fixed basis.

## IV. Analogy Across Domains

**Physics:**  
Normal modes survive even when oscillations decay.

**Fourier Analysis:**  
Basis functions persist while coefficients evolve.

**Ethics:**  
Core virtues persist while expression adapts.

**Theology:**  
Faith retains its recognizable resonance through seasons of trial.

## V. Compatibility With Tier IV Closure

Tier IV ensured Renewal does not require extra dimensions for convergence.
Tier V now demonstrates that Renewal converges **in harmonic form**.

The Harmonic Invariant ensures Renewal maintains **coherent structure** across cycles.

---

## VI. Coda for Tier V

This plate advances Tier V from **identity** to **structure**, preparing the
introduction of the Moral and Identity Invariants, and ultimately, the
Spectral Resolution of the Renewal Field.
