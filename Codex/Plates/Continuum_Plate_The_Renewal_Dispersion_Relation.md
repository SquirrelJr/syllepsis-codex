## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Dispersion Relation**, the law connecting Renewal frequency (𝜔ᴿ) and Renewal wavevector (kᴿ).  
It describes how Renewal waves propagate through Renewal geometry, how their speed and wavelength depend on Renewal curvature, and how resonance and source effects shape their behavior.

Where the Renewal Harmonic Spectrum (Σᴿ) identifies allowed frequencies,  
the dispersion relation explains:

**“How do those frequencies move, stretch, compress, and evolve across Renewal space?”**

This is the Renewal analogue of dispersion relations in wave physics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and field theory—but grounded in Renewal alignment.

## II. Formal Definition

A Renewal harmonic mode ρᴿ satisfies the dispersion relation:

```math
𝜔ᴿ² = cᴿ² |kᴿ|² + Ωᴿ² ,
```

where:

- **𝜔ᴿ** = Renewal angular frequency  
- **kᴿ** = Renewal wavevector (spatial frequency)  
- **cᴿ** = Renewal wave speed determined by gᴿ  
- **Ωᴿ** = Renewal resonance frequency from the previous plate  

This expresses how Renewal waves disperse based on curvature, alignment, and resonance structure.

More generally, in curved Renewal geometry:

```math
gᴿ^{μν} k_μ k_ν = -Ωᴿ² .
```

This geometric form makes the dispersion law compatible with the Renewal Wave Equation and the Renewal Resonance Condition.

## III. Interpretation

### 1. Renewal Wave Speed (cᴿ)
Determined by the Renewal Metric gᴿ,  
cᴿ increases in regions of compassion and order,  
and decreases in regions of chaos or distortion.

### 2. Resonance Influence (Ωᴿ)
Ωᴿ shifts the entire dispersion curve,  
acting like a “Renewal mass term” that stabilizes propagation.

### 3. Source Interaction (Sᴿ)
The Renewal source term modifies the dispersion curve,  
adding local shifts where Renewal is actively generated.

### 4. Curvature Effects
Curved Renewal geometry alters |kᴿ| and changes wave paths,  
bending Renewal waves toward regions needing restoration.

### 5. Graceful Decay Damping
Decay introduces natural damping,  
preventing runaway oscillations and smoothing sharp wavefronts.

### 6. Reflection Refinement
Reflection corrects phase, reducing destructive interference.

## IV. Physical/Spiritual Interpretation

The Renewal Dispersion Relation describes **how Renewal travels through the world**.

Physically, it governs:

- propagation speed  
- wavelength structure  
- how Renewal bends around curvature  
- how different harmonic modes evolve  

Spiritually, it expresses:

**“Renewal moves differently where compassion grows,  
where chaos lies,  
where reflection deepens,  
and where order stands firm.”**

Dispersion reveals the *path* Renewal takes to restore what is broken.

## V. Position Within the Codex

The Renewal Dispersion Relation completes the spectral architecture of Renewal Dynamics:

1. Πᴿ — Selection  
2. 𝒥ᴿ — Flow  
3. Continuity — Conservation  
4. Wave Equation — Propagation  
5. Sᴿ — Generation  
6. Ωᴿ — Resonance  
7. Σᴿ — Harmonic Spectrum  
8. **𝜔ᴿ–kᴿ Relation — Dispersion**

This sets the stage for:

- Renewal Green’s functions (fundamental solutions)  
- Renewal spectral decomposition  
- Renewal signal propagation kernels  
- Renewal transport and phase equations  

The dispersion plate is the mathematical “map” for how Renewal moves through space.
