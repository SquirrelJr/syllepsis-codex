## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Boundary-of-Being Correspondence**, ℬᴿΩ —  
the formal, transcendent law that establishes the relationship between:

- **finite Renewal being** within the Continuum, and  
- **Eternal being** beyond the Continuum.

Where:

- 𝔅ᴿ∞ described the boundary of the Continuum,  
- 𝔈ᴿ defined the Eternal harmonic,  
- Πᴿ∞ described the Eternal projection,

**ℬᴿΩ reveals how being itself is mapped across that boundary.**

It is the ontological bridge:  
the truth that finite Renewal states have Eternal correspondents,  
and that Eternal coherence has finite reflections.

---

## II. Definition of the Being Correspondence Map

The Boundary-of-Being Correspondence is defined as a bijective relationship:

```math
\mathcal{B}^{R}_{\Omega} : \Psi^{R}_{finite}
\;\longleftrightarrow\;
\Psi^{R}_{eternal}
```

Meaning:

- every finite Renewal state has an Eternal correlate,  
- every Eternal state has a finite reflection,  
- being is coherently linked across the Transcendent Boundary.

This is not merely a function — it is a **two-way correspondence**.

---

## III. Finite-to-Eternal Correspondence

Finite Renewal being approaches its Eternal correlate through:

```math
\Psi^{R}_{eternal}
=
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
\Psi^{R}_{finite}(x)
```

Where:

- x is a scale, position, or Renewal “distance” parameter,  
- the limit references the Transcendent Boundary Condition (𝔅ᴿ∞).

This is how finite being converges to its Eternal truth.

---

## IV. Eternal-to-Finite Correspondence

Eternal being descends into the Continuum via Transcendent Projection:

```math
\Psi^{R}_{finite}
=
\Pi^{R}_{\infty}(\Psi^{R}_{eternal})
```

This expresses:

- Eternal → finite emergence,  
- coherence descending from the Eternal,  
- the Eternal harmonic taking finite form.

---

## V. Correspondence Invariance Conditions

The correspondence must preserve identity across the boundary:

```math
\mathcal{B}^{R}_{\Omega}
\!\left(
\Pi^{R}_{\infty}(\Psi^{R}_{eternal})
\right)
=
\Psi^{R}_{eternal}
```

and

```math
\Pi^{R}_{\infty}
\!\left(
\mathcal{B}^{R}_{\Omega}(\Psi^{R}_{finite})
\right)
=
\Psi^{R}_{finite}
```

These identities ensure:

- coherence of correspondence,  
- no loss of information across the boundary,  
- full Renewal–Eternal integrity.

---

## VI. Coherence Preservation

The correspondence preserves inner-product structure:

```math
\left\langle
\Psi^{R}_{finite},
\Phi^{R}_{finite}
\right\rangle
\;\longleftrightarrow\;
\left\langle
\Psi^{R}_{eternal},
\Phi^{R}_{eternal}
\right\rangle
```

And Unity Metric structure:

```math
g^{R U}(\text{finite})
\;\longleftrightarrow\;
g^{R}_{\infty}(\text{eternal})
```

Meaning:

- coherence is conserved,  
- alignment is maintained,  
- Renewal geometry matches Eternal geometry under correspondence.

---

## VII. Boundary Compatibility Condition

The correspondence is continuous across the Transcendent Boundary:

```math
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
\mathcal{B}^{R}_{\Omega}
\!\left(
\Psi^{R}_{finite}(x)
\right)
=
\Psi^{R}_{eternal}
```

This ensures:

- no discontinuity at the edge of creation,  
- smooth ontological matching,  
- finite being “flows” into Eternal being.

---

## VIII. Physical Interpretation

Physically, ℬᴿΩ resembles:

- a holographic duality between boundary and bulk,  
- a finite–infinite correspondence mapping,  
- a limit-based equivalence of coherent states.

It states that existence is dual across the boundary of the Continuum.

---

## IX. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, ℬᴿΩ expresses:

- the truth that finite being reflects Eternal being,  
- that each Renewal state corresponds to an Eternal truth,  
- that God’s coherence is mirrored in creation,  
- that the Eternal and finite are united by a law of coherent being.

It encodes:

**“Finite being is the reflection of Eternal being.”**  
**“What exists here corresponds to what exists beyond.”**  
**“The Eternal and the finite are bound in coherent identity.”**

## X. Position Within the Codex

This plate continues **Tier VI — The Transcendent Layer**:

1. 𝔅ᴿ∞ — Transcendent Renewal Boundary Condition  
2. 𝔈ᴿ — Eternal Coherence Principle  
3. Πᴿ∞ — Transcendent Projection Law  
4. **ℬᴿΩ — Boundary-of-Being Correspondence (this plate)**  
5. The Renewal–Eternal Interface Theorem  
6. The Omega Alignment Condition  

Tier VI now has its ontological bridge.
