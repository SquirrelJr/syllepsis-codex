## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal–Eternal Interface Theorem**, ℑᴿ∞ —  
the unified law describing how **finite Renewal dynamics**  
interact with, converge to, and seamlessly meet  
the **unchanging Eternal coherence** at the Transcendent Boundary.

Where the previous Tier VI plates established:

- 𝔅ᴿ∞ — the Transcendent Boundary Condition,  
- 𝔈ᴿ — the Eternal Coherence Principle,  
- Πᴿ∞ — the Transcendent Projection Law,  
- ℬᴿΩ — the Being Correspondence,

ℑᴿ∞ provides the **harmonic, geometric, and dynamical handshake**  
between the Continuum and the Eternal.

It is the theorem ensuring the boundary of creation is coherent, stable,  
and perfectly aligned with the Eternal.

## II. The Interface Equation

At the Transcendent Boundary:

```math
\Psi^{R}_{boundary}
=
\Pi^{R}_{\infty}(H^{R}_{eternal})
```

Meaning:

- the Renewal boundary state **is** the Eternal projection,  
- the boundary value of the Continuum is set by the Eternal harmonic.

---

## III. Continuity of Coherence (Metric Interface)

As \( x \rightarrow \infty \):

```math
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
g^{R U}\!\left(
\Psi^{R}(x),
H^{R}_{eternal}
\right)
=
g^{R}_{\infty}
\!\left(
\Psi^{R}_{eternal},
H^{R}_{eternal}
\right)
```

Interpretation:

- the Unity Metric matches the Eternal Metric at the boundary,  
- coherence is continuous from the finite to the Eternal.

---

## IV. Transport Interface Condition (Zero-Flux Limit)

At the Transcendent Boundary:

```math
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
J^{R}(x)
=
0
```

Renewal transport vanishes because:

- the Eternal has no gradients,  
- there is no misalignment to correct,  
- transport flow resolves into rest.

---

## V. Harmonic Interface Condition

Renewal harmonics converge to the Eternal harmonic:

```math
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
H^{R}(x)
=
H^{R}_{eternal}
```

Interpretation:

- resonance becomes identical to the Eternal tone,  
- the Continuum tunes itself to divine coherence at infinity.

---

## VI. Projection–Correspondence Compatibility

Projection and correspondence must commute:

```math
\mathcal{B}^{R}_{\Omega}
\!\left(
\Psi^{R}_{boundary}
\right)
=
\Psi^{R}_{eternal}
```

Meaning:

- the Eternal counterpart of the boundary state  
  is exactly the Eternal state itself,  
- the interface preserves ontological identity.

---

## VII. Interface Stability Law

At the boundary:

```math
\partial_{t} \Psi^{R}
=
0
```

No further Renewal evolution occurs because:

- Renewal has reached Eternal alignment,  
- the boundary state is fully stabilized.

---

## VIII. Interface Differential Structure

The Renewal field becomes position-invariant at the boundary:

```math
\partial_{x} \Psi^{R}
=
0
\quad \text{as } x \rightarrow \infty
```

This expresses:

- a fixed-point manifold,  
- absolute coherence,  
- boundary rest.

---

## IX. Physical Interpretation

Physically, ℑᴿ∞ resembles:

- a fixed-point boundary condition for nonlinear fields,  
- a zero-flux vacuum interface,  
- a harmonic convergence condition at infinity,  
- the boundary matching between finite dynamics and an infinite symmetric domain.

It is the stabilizing interface of existence.

---

## X. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, ℑᴿ∞ expresses:

- the seamless unity between creation and its Eternal Source,  
- the truth that Renewal converges into God without fracture,  
- the meeting of temporal coherence with divine perfection,  
- the harmony of creation touching its origin.

It encodes:

**“The Eternal and the Continuum meet without fracture.”**  
**“Renewal converges into the Eternal in perfect rest.”**  
**“Creation’s boundary is a harmonic union with God.”**

## XI. Position Within the Codex

This plate continues **Tier VI — The Transcendent Layer**:

1. 𝔅ᴿ∞ — Transcendent Renewal Boundary Condition  
2. 𝔈ᴿ — Eternal Coherence Principle  
3. Πᴿ∞ — Transcendent Projection Law  
4. ℬᴿΩ — Boundary-of-Being Correspondence  
5. **ℑᴿ∞ — Renewal–Eternal Interface Theorem (this plate)**  
6. The Omega Alignment Condition  

Tier VI now possesses its dynamic interface between Renewal and the Eternal.
