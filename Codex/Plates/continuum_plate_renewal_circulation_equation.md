## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Circulation Equation**,  
the rotational counterpart to the Renewal Divergence Equation.

Where divergence describes expansion or contraction,  
circulation describes:

- rotation  
- resonance  
- spiral dynamics  
- cyclical coherence  
- toroidal renewal loops  

This plate reveals the **spin geometry** of renewal.

## II. Curl of Renewal Velocity

The fundamental quantity is:

```math
∇×V_R
```

Interpretation:

- ∇×V_R ≠ 0 → renewal contains rotational or spiral motion  
- ∇×V_R = 0 → renewal flow is irrotational  

Circulation reveals **loops, swirls, and resonant renewal paths**.

---

## III. Renewal Circulation Equation

The circulation of renewal density obeys:

```math
∂ω_R/∂t = ∇×V_R
```

Where:

- ω_R is the **renewal vorticity**  

This describes how rotational patterns grow, diminish, or stabilize.

---

## IV. Renewal Vorticity Definition

```math
ω_R = ∇×V_R
```

Interpretation:

- ω_R > 0 → constructive spirals (insight, alignment, virtuous cycles)  
- ω_R < 0 → destructive spirals (rumination, collapse, regressions)  
- ω_R = 0 → no rotational structure  

Vorticity captures the **spin signature** of renewal.

## V. Coupling to Renewal Flux

```math
∇×J_R = ∇×(ρ_R · V_R)
```

This shows:

- how density gradients induce rotation  
- how Order/Reflection generate coherent loops  
- how Chaos/Decay introduce turbulent spirals  

The rotational flux governs **whether renewal stabilizes or destabilizes**.

## VI. Interpretation of Renewal Circulation

Circulation reveals:

1. **Constructive Spiraling**  
   Renewal loops upward, accumulating coherence.

2. **Destructive Spiraling**  
   Renewal collapses inward, forming negative attractors.

3. **Toroidal Renewal Fields**  
   Closed renewal loops (common near Ψ-boundary).

4. **Standing Renewal Waves**  
   Balanced rotational structures that oscillate without collapse.

5. **Resonant Renewal Orbits**  
   Renewal traces repeating paths that sustain momentum.

6. **Path-Dependent Renewal**  
   Behaviors and reflections shaped by cyclical flow.

---

## VII. Stability Condition

```math
| ∇×V_R | ≤ C_threshold
```

Where C_threshold depends on:

- renewal density  
- coherence  
- operator balance (O, R, D, Χ)  
- proximity to transition boundaries  

If exceeded:

- positive rotation → runaway ignition  
- negative rotation → collapse cycles  

Controlled vorticity sustains **harmonic cyclic renewal**.

## VIII. Summary Statement

The Renewal Circulation Equation formalizes the **rotational geometry**  
of the Renewal Field.

Where divergence explains spatial spreading,  
circulation explains **loops, spirals, toroidal flow, and resonant cycles**.

It describes how renewal spins, stabilizes, resonates, or collapses  
within the living harmonic field.
