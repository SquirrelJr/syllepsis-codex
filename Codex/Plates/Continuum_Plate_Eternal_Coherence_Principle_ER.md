## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Eternal Coherence Principle**, 𝔈ᴿ —  
the law stating that the **Eternal maintains a perfect, unchanging harmonic state**  
that all Renewal coherence ultimately aligns toward.

Where:

- 𝔅ᴿ∞ defined the *boundary* between the Continuum and the Eternal,  
- **𝔈ᴿ defines the Eternal itself**:  
  its harmonic, its stability, its coherence, its unchanging nature.

𝔈ᴿ is the anchor, the reference, the fixed point,  
the transcendent constant against which all Renewal is measured.

---

## II. Eternal Harmonic Definition

The Eternal harmonic is defined as:

```math
H^{R}_{eternal}
=
\text{constant across all } t, x, \text{ and tiers}
```

Mathematically:

```math
\partial_{t} H^{R}_{eternal} = 0
\qquad
\partial_{x} H^{R}_{eternal} = 0
```

Meaning:

- it does not evolve,  
- it does not change with position,  
- it is the perfect harmonic of the Eternal.

This is the unchanging “tone” of divine coherence.

---

## III. Eternal Coherence Condition

A Renewal state Ψᴿ achieves Eternal coherence when:

```math
\left\langle
\Psi^{R},
H^{R}_{eternal}
\right\rangle
\ge
0
```

Equivalent Unity Metric form:

```math
g^{R U}(\Psi^{R},\, H^{R}_{eternal})
\ge
0
```

Interpretation:

- coherence is measured by alignment with the Eternal harmonic,  
- the Eternal is the reference for all Renewal alignment.

---

## IV. Eternal Projection Law

The Eternal projection operator satisfies:

```math
\Pi^{R}_{eternal}(\Psi^{R})
=
H^{R}_{eternal}
```

Meaning:

- no matter the input,  
- the Eternal projection returns the Eternal harmonic itself.

This expresses the Eternal’s invariance under transformation.

---

## V. Eternal Rest Condition

At infinite convergence:

```math
\Psi^{R}
\longrightarrow
H^{R}_{eternal}
```

This is the asymptotic limit of all Renewal flows  
as they return to the Eternal Source.

---

## VI. Eternal Curvature Definition

The Eternal curvature tensor is:

```math
\mathcal{R}^{R}_{eternal}
=
0
```

Because the Eternal contains:

- no distortion,  
- no bending,  
- no chaotic oscillation,  
- no deviation from perfect coherence.

The Eternal is geometrically flat  
in the sense of perfect harmonic simplicity.

---

## VII. Eternal Transport Condition

The Eternal transport current is:

```math
J^{R}_{eternal}
=
0
```

Because:

- the Eternal has no gradients,  
- no misalignment exists,  
- no correction or transport is required.

The Eternal is complete unto itself.

---

## VIII. Physical Interpretation

Physically, the Eternal Coherence Principle resembles:

- a global fixed point of a nonlinear dynamical system,  
- a fully stable vacuum state,  
- the absolute symmetry of perfect coherence,  
- the final renormalization endpoint of Renewal flow.

It provides the **asymptotic anchor** for all Renewal fields.

---

## IX. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, 𝔈ᴿ expresses the deepest Tier VI truth:

- God’s harmony is unchanging,  
- God’s order does not drift or evolve,  
- all Renewal ultimately aligns with His coherence,  
- the Eternal is the perfect fixed point of all being.

It encodes:

**“The Eternal is perfect harmony.”**  
**“What is Eternal does not change.”**  
**“All Renewal aligns toward the coherence of God.”**

This plate anchors the entire Codex in its divine root.

## X. Position Within the Codex

This plate continues **Tier VI — The Transcendent Layer**:

1. 𝔅ᴿ∞ — Transcendent Renewal Boundary Condition  
2. **𝔈ᴿ — Eternal Coherence Principle (this plate)**  
3. The Transcendent Projection Law  
4. The Boundary-of-Being Correspondence  
5. The Renewal–Eternal Interface Theorem  
6. The Omega Alignment Condition  

Tier VI now has its harmonic anchor.
