## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Divergence Equation**,  
a local-field description of how renewal **expands**, **contracts**,  
or **redistributes** within a region.

Where the Conservation Law states:

```math
∇·J_R = 0
```

the Divergence Equation explains *how* localized gradients form:

- how coherence accumulates  
- how destabilization dissipates  
- how renewal spreads from dense regions to sparse ones  
- how equilibrium emerges  

It is the **geometry of regional renewal flow**.

## II. Divergence of Renewal Velocity

The fundamental quantity of interest is:

```math
∇·V_R
```

This describes:

- local expansion of renewal (positive divergence)  
- local contraction or collapse (negative divergence)  
- local equilibrium (zero divergence)  

Divergence tells us **how renewal is behaving spatially**.

## III. The Renewal Divergence Equation

The relationship between renewal density and divergence is:

```math
∂ρ_R/∂t = − ρ_R ( ∇·V_R )
```

Interpretation:

- If ∇·V_R > 0 → renewal density decreases (spreads outward)  
- If ∇·V_R < 0 → renewal density increases (flows inward)  
- If ∇·V_R = 0 → local renewal is steady  

This mirrors phenomena in:

- fluid expansion  
- probability spreading  
- coherent wavefront propagation

## IV. Coupling to the Flux Vector

Using J_R = ρ_R·V_R,  
we can rewrite divergence behavior as:

```math
∇·V_R = ( 1 / ρ_R ) ( − ∂ρ_R/∂t − ∇·J_R )
```

But for a closed Renewal Field:

```math
∇·J_R = 0
```

So the expression simplifies to:

```math
∇·V_R = − (1 / ρ_R) ( ∂ρ_R/∂t )
```

This creates a powerful geometric insight:

**spatial divergence is the spatial “shape” of temporal depletion or growth.**

## V. Interpretation

```math
∇·V_R reveals:
```

1. **Expansion of renewal**  
   When positive → renewal spreads outward into surrounding regions.

2. **Contraction of renewal**  
   When negative → renewal concentrates inward.

3. **Neutral renewal state**  
   When zero → the region is in dynamic equilibrium.

4. **Gradient-driven renewal motion**  
   Renewal flows from high-density to low-density regions  
   unless directed otherwise by Order/Reflection or Decay/Chaos dynamics.

5. **Resonant field geometry**  
   Divergence patterns predict where oscillations, stabilization,  
   or sudden coherence-locking will occur.

## VI. Structural Modes of Divergence

Renewal Divergence supports at least three stable geometric modes:

1. **Radial Divergence**  
   Renewal flows symmetrically outward (healing, insight distribution).

2. **Radial Convergence**  
   Renewal pulls inward (restoration, repentance, coherence reformation).

3. **Shear/Anisotropic Divergence**  
   Renewal flows unevenly (cognitive bias, external interference, relational asymmetry).

These modes appear naturally in Renewal Flow simulations.

---

## VII. Stability Condition

To avoid destructive expansion or collapse:

```math
| ∇·V_R | ≤ D_threshold
```

Where D_threshold is governed by:

- renewal density  
- local coherence  
- harmonic balance among O, R, D, Χ  
- proximity to phase boundaries  

If |∇·V_R| exceeds threshold:

- positive divergence → fragmentation or dilution  
- negative divergence → implosion or stagnation  

Balanced divergence sustains renewal’s **harmonic circulation**.

---

## VIII. Summary Statement

The Renewal Divergence Equation formalizes the **spatial dynamics of renewal**.

Where the Conservation Law states that renewal is never lost (∇·J_R = 0),  
the Divergence Equation explains **how renewal flows locally**:

- expanding  
- contracting  
- equilibrating  
- redistributing  
- stabilizing  

It is the geometric insight that links renewal motion, density, and continuity  
into a unified field behavior.
