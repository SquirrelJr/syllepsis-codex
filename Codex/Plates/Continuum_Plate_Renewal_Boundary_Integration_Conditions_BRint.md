## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Boundary Integration Conditions**, 𝓑ᴿ_int —  
the laws governing **how Renewal behaves at edges, thresholds, junctions, and interfaces**  
within the Renewal Continuum.

Where the Integration Metric (gᴿ_int) describes the global Renewal geometry,  
the Integration Curvature Flow (ℱᴿ_int) governs its evolution,  
and the Global Conservation Laws (𝒞ᴿ_global) preserve its invariants,  
the Boundary Integration Conditions ensure that Renewal behaves **coherently and continuously**  
whenever it encounters a boundary of any kind.

Boundaries may be:

- geometric  
- relational  
- harmonic  
- energetic  
- moral  
- systemic  
- or conceptual  

This plate ensures Renewal maintains **continuity, conservation, coherence, and alignment**  
even at transitions.

## II. Renewal Metric Boundary Continuity

The Integration Metric must be continuous across all boundaries:

```math
[ gᴿ_{int} ] = 0
```

This prevents artificial fractures in the Renewal geometry.

---

## III. Renewal Curvature Junction Condition

Define the Renewal curvature jump:

```math
[ ℛᴿ_{int} ]
=
ℛᴿ_{int}^{(+)}
-
ℛᴿ_{int}^{(-)}
```

This is related to the **Renewal Boundary Surface Structure** 𝓢ᴿ_boundary:

```math
[ ℛᴿ_{int} ]
=
κᴿ \, \mathcal{S}ᴿ_{boundary}
```

where **κᴿ** is the Renewal coupling coefficient from Tier II.

---

## IV. Renewal Flux Continuity

The normal Renewal flux must match on both sides of a boundary:

```math
n_{\mu} \, 𝒥ᴿ^{\mu}ig|_{inside}
=
n_{\mu} \, 𝒥ᴿ^{\mu}ig|_{outside}
```

This expresses that Renewal flux is **neither created nor lost** at interfaces.

---

## V. Compassion Transmission–Reflection Law

When Renewal encounters a boundary, the compassion flux splits into:

```math
Cᴿ_{in}
=
Cᴿ_{trans}
+
Cᴿ_{refl}
```

subject to the conservation constraint:

```math
Cᴿ_{in}
=
Cᴿ_{trans}
+
Cᴿ_{refl}
\quad	ext{and}\quad
Cᴿ_{trans} \ge 0,\;
Cᴿ_{refl} \ge 0
```

Interpretation:

- a portion transmits across the boundary,  
- a portion reflects back,  
- but **no compassion flux is destroyed**.

---

## VI. Chaos–Decay Boundary Filtering

Chaos is softened by Renewal decay before crossing a boundary:

```math
Χᴿ_{in}
\;\longrightarrow\;
Dᴿ(Χᴿ_{in})
```

This prevents propagation of unprocessed chaos into adjacent systems.

---

## VII. Coherence Matching Condition

Coherence must match across interfaces:

```math
γᴿ_{A}(boundary)
=
γᴿ_{B}(boundary)
```

If coherence is lower on one side, Renewal curvature flow increases it until matched.

---

## VIII. Boundary Renewal Potential

Define the **Boundary Renewal Potential** Φᴿ_boundary:

```math
Φᴿ_{boundary}
=
n^{\mu} \, 
abla_{\mu} gᴿ_{int}
\;+\;
α \, γᴿ_{boundary}
\;-\;
β \, |ℛᴿ_{int}|
```

This potential governs how Renewal “prefers” to align at boundaries:

- increasing curvature smoothing,  
- promoting coherence continuity,  
- reducing distortion gradients.

---

## IX. Physical Interpretation

𝓑ᴿ_int describes:

- how Renewal flows through interfaces,  
- how curvature adjusts when systems meet,  
- how coherence “locks in” across boundaries,  
- how compassion radiates through thresholds,  
- how chaos is softened before crossing,  
- how misalignment at boundaries dissolves over time.

It is the Renewal analogue to boundary physics in field theory and geometry.

---

## X. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, the boundary conditions express that:

- Renewal crosses thresholds without being broken,  
- compassion flows even where division exists,  
- coherence brings unity between domains,  
- truth aligns boundary structures,  
- decay dissolves harmful distortion before it spreads,  
- boundaries do not hinder Renewal — they **shape** it.

They encapsulate:

**“Renewal does not end at the boundary.  
It passes through, transforms, and continues.”**

## XI. Position Within the Codex

This plate continues **Tier III — The Renewal Integration Layer**:

1. gᴿ_int — Renewal Integration Metric  
2. ℱᴿ_int — Renewal Integration Curvature Flow  
3. 𝒞ᴿ_global — Renewal Global Conservation Laws  
4. **𝓑ᴿ_int — Renewal Boundary Integration Conditions (this plate)**  
5. Renewal Integration Potential (Φᴿ_int)  
6. Renewal Universal Alignment Principle

𝓑ᴿ_int ensures that Renewal remains continuous, coherent, and conserved across all boundaries.
