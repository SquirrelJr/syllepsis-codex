## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Renewal Global Conservation Laws**, 𝒞ᴿ_global —  
the universal invariants preserved across the **entire Renewal manifold**.

Where the Renewal Integration Metric (gᴿ_int) establishes global geometry,  
and the Renewal Integration Curvature Flow (ℱᴿ_int) defines how that geometry evolves through time,  
the Global Conservation Laws specify **what Renewal preserves everywhere, always**.

These laws give the Renewal Continuum its **macro-level consistency**,  
ensuring that alignment, coherence, compassion, reflection, order, and decay all remain  
**conserved, redistributed, or transformed—but never annihilated.**

---

## II. Global Renewal Continuity Law

Define the **Global Renewal Current** 𝒥ᴿ_global:

```math
\𝒥ᴿ_{global}^{\mu}
=
\sum_{systems} \, 𝒥ᴿ_{(i)}^{\mu}
```

The global continuity equation is:

```math

abla_{\mu} \, 𝒥ᴿ_{global}^{\mu}
=
0
```

This expresses that Renewal “flows” globally but cannot be created or destroyed.

---

## III. Conservation of Renewal Alignment

Define the **Global Renewal Alignment Integral**:

```math
Aᴿ
=
\int \Piᴿ(\psi) \, dVᴿ_{int}
```

where **Πᴿ** is the Renewal Projection Operator and **ψ** is the integrated Renewal field.

Then:

```math
rac{dAᴿ}{dt} = 0
```

Alignment is never lost — it is redistributed across the Renewal manifold.

---

## IV. Conservation of Renewal Coherence

Global Renewal coherence satisfies:

```math
rac{\partial}{\partial t}
\left(
\int γᴿ_{global} \, dVᴿ_{int}

ight)
=
0
```

Meaning:

- coherence may **flow**,  
- coherence may **shift**,  
- coherence may **transfer between systems**,  

but the **total coherence of the Renewal universe is invariant.**

---

## V. Conservation of Compassion Flux

Define the Renewal compassion current:

```math
Cᴿ^{\mu}
=
Cᴿ \, 𝒥ᴿ^{\mu}
```

Then the global conservation law:

```math

abla_{\mu} Cᴿ^{\mu} = 0
```

Compassion propagates without loss; it is a **globally conserved restorative flux**.

---

## VI. Renewal Integration Entropy Bound

From the Integration Curvature Flow:

```math
Sᴿ_{int}
=
\int |ℛᴿ_{int}| \, dVᴿ
```

The entropy inequality:

```math
Sᴿ_{int} \ge 0,
\quad
rac{dSᴿ_{int}}{dt} \le 0
```

Global distortion **cannot increase**.  
Renewal geometry **monotonically moves toward harmony**.

---

## VII. Conservation of Renewal Resonance

For each global harmonic mode n:

```math
rac{\partial}{\partial t}
\left(
Σᴿ_{n}

ight)
=
0
```

The Renewal harmonic spectrum is **globally invariant**.

---

## VIII. Conservation of the Global Renewal Norm

Define the integrated Renewal norm:

```math
\langle \psiᴿ, \psiᴿ 
angle_{int}
=
\int \psiᴿ \psiᴿ^{*} \, dVᴿ_{int}
```

This quantity is preserved:

```math
rac{d}{dt}
\langle \psiᴿ, \psiᴿ 
angle_{int}
=
0
```

This law expresses the permanence of Renewal’s global “magnitude.”

---

## IX. Physical Interpretation

The global conservation laws describe:

- redistribution of Renewal without loss  
- propagation of coherence through boundaries  
- invariance of global harmony  
- the impossibility of destroying aligned Renewal  
- decay transforming chaos without reducing total Renewal  
- compassion’s conservation as a restorative flux  

They ensure the Renewal Continuum remains **structurally stable across scales**.

---

## X. Spiritual Interpretation

These laws express that:

- what aligns with Renewal cannot be lost  
- coherence may shift, but its totality remains  
- compassion flows eternally through the Renewal manifold  
- distortion decreases but truth remains  
- reflection transforms but does not erase  
- decay restores but does not diminish  

They embody the principle:

**“What is of Renewal remains.  
What is against Renewal is transformed.”**

## XI. Position Within the Codex

This plate continues the **Renewal Integration Layer — Tier III**:

1. gᴿ_int — Renewal Integration Metric  
2. ℱᴿ_int — Renewal Integration Curvature Flow  
3. **𝒞ᴿ_global — Renewal Global Conservation Laws (this plate)**  
4. Renewal Boundary Integration Conditions  
5. Renewal Integration Potential (Φᴿ_int)  
6. Renewal Universal Alignment Principle

These conservation laws provide the universal invariants governing Renewal at the highest scale.
