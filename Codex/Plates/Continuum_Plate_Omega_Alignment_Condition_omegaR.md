## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate defines the **Omega Alignment Condition**, Ωᴿ —  
the **terminal coherence law** governing Renewal’s final convergence  
into the Eternal harmonic.

Where previous Tier VI plates established:

- 𝔅ᴿ∞ — the boundary of transcendence  
- 𝔈ᴿ — the Eternal harmonic  
- Πᴿ∞ — Eternal projection  
- ℬᴿΩ — Renewal–Eternal correspondence  
- ℑᴿ∞ — the interface theorem  

**Ωᴿ defines the *completion* of Renewal.**

It is the final attractor of all Renewal flow,  
the state in which creation aligns perfectly with the Eternal.

---

## II. The Omega Alignment Equation

The Omega-aligned Renewal state satisfies:

```math
\Psi^{R}_{\Omega}
=
H^{R}_{eternal}
```

Meaning:

- the final Renewal state **equals** the Eternal harmonic,  
- Renewal concludes in perfect coherence with the Eternal.

Ωᴿ is the *terminal fixed point* of the entire system.

---

## III. The Omega Convergence Law

Renewal approaches Ωᴿ asymptotically:

```math
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}
\Psi^{R}(t)
=
H^{R}_{eternal}
```

This applies to:

- Renewal fields,  
- Renewal harmonics,  
- Renewal transport structures,  
- Unity metric interactions,  
- The entire Renewal Continuum.

All flows converge into Eternal coherence.

---

## IV. The Omega Stability Condition

At Ωᴿ:

```math
\partial_{t} \Psi^{R} = 0
```

(no temporal evolution)

```math
\partial_{x} \Psi^{R} = 0
```

(no spatial deviation)

```math
J^{R} = 0
```

(no transport)

```math
\mathcal{R}^{R} = 0
```

(no curvature, no distortion)

Ωᴿ is perfect stillness  
in perfect alignment  
with perfect harmony.

---

## V. Omega–Interface Compatibility

The Omega-aligned state *is* the boundary state:

```math
\Psi^{R}_{\Omega}
=
\Psi^{R}_{boundary}
```

This links Ωᴿ directly to the Renewal–Eternal Interface (ℑᴿ∞):

- the final state of Renewal  
- equals the Eternal boundary projection.

---

## VI. Omega Projection Identity

The Eternal projection acts trivially on Ωᴿ:

```math
\Pi^{R}_{\infty}(\Psi^{R}_{\Omega})
=
H^{R}_{eternal}
```

Because Ωᴿ and the Eternal harmonic are identical.

---

## VII. Omega Correspondence Condition

Under the Boundary-of-Being Correspondence (ℬᴿΩ):

```math
\mathcal{B}^{R}_{\Omega}(\Psi^{R}_{\Omega})
=
\Psi^{R}_{eternal}
```

Meaning:

- the Eternal correspondent of the Omega state  
  is the Eternal state itself,  
- Ωᴿ is the full Renewal–Eternal alignment.

---

## VIII. Omega Unity Metric Condition

Perfect unity is achieved when:

```math
g^{R U}
\!\left(
\Psi^{R}_{\Omega},
H^{R}_{eternal}
\right)
=
g^{R}_{\infty}
\!\left(
H^{R}_{eternal},
H^{R}_{eternal}
\right)
```

Meaning:

- the Unity Metric reduces to the Eternal Metric,  
- coherence is absolute,  
- alignment is total.

---

## IX. Physical Interpretation

Physically, Ωᴿ resembles:

- the global ground state of perfect symmetry,  
- the final attractor of nonlinear coherent systems,  
- the asymptotic fixed point of renewal flow,  
- the maximal coherence achievable in any field.

Ωᴿ is the end of all evolution.

---

## X. Spiritual Interpretation

Spiritually, Ωᴿ expresses the deepest truth of the Codex:

- all Renewal returns to God,  
- all coherence finds its rest in the Eternal,  
- all being aligns with divine harmony,  
- Renewal achieves completion in perfect unity.

It encodes:

**“Renewal reaches its completion in the Eternal.”**  
**“The final alignment is oneness with God’s coherence.”**  
**“All Renewal converges into eternal harmony.”**

## XI. Position Within the Codex

This plate completes **Tier VI — The Transcendent Layer**:

1. 𝔅ᴿ∞ — Transcendent Renewal Boundary Condition  
2. 𝔈ᴿ — Eternal Coherence Principle  
3. Πᴿ∞ — Transcendent Projection Law  
4. ℬᴿΩ — Boundary-of-Being Correspondence  
5. ℑᴿ∞ — Renewal–Eternal Interface Theorem  
6. **Ωᴿ — The Omega Alignment Condition (this plate)**  

Tier VI is now fully formed —  
the final, complete mapping of Renewal to the Eternal.
