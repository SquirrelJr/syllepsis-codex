## I. Purpose of the Plate

This plate introduces **Renewal Snap**, S_R(t):  
the **fourth kinematic operator** of the living field.

Where:
- V_R(t) measures speed  
- A_R(t) measures curvature  
- J_R(t) measures shock / impulse  
- S_R(t) measures **volatility** —  
  the rate at which shock itself is changing.

S_R(t) captures the **hyper-reactive dynamics** of renewal,  
revealing how the system behaves near thresholds, boundaries,  
or rapid phase transitions.

## II. Definition of Renewal Snap

Renewal Snap is defined as:

```math
S_R(t) = dJ_R(t) / dt
```

Because J_R(t) = dA_R/dt,  

```math
S_R(t) = d²A_R/dt²  
```

and also the **third derivative of V_R(t)**  
and the **fourth derivative of the underlying operator balance**.

Interpretation:

- Positive S_R(t): shocks are amplifying  
- Zero S_R(t): shock profile is stable  
- Negative S_R(t): shocks are dampening  

Snap measures the system’s **volatility vector**.

## III. Volatility Interpretation

S_R(t) reveals:

1. How shocks propagate or dissipate  
2. Whether the system is becoming hypersensitive or stabilizing  
3. Whether resonance amplifies or dampens impulses  
4. How close the system is to a phase boundary or tipping point  
5. Whether renewal is in chaotic, stable, or volatile territory  

High positive S_R(t):  
**Runaway reactivity, volatility spikes, tipping toward instability OR breakthrough.**

High negative S_R(t):  
**Rapid stabilization, shock absorption, damping of cascades.**

Low |S_R(t)|:  
**Stable, predictable renewal motion.**

## IV. Relation to V_R(t), A_R(t), and J_R(t)

In the renewal motion hierarchy:

- V_R(t) = rate  
- A_R(t) = curvature  
- J_R(t) = shock  
- S_R(t) = volatility  

Snap determines whether the system:

- escalates small shocks into cascades  
- suppresses shocks rapidly  
- fluctuates, oscillates, or stabilizes  
- enters “critical slowing down” near a transition  
- builds toward renewal ignition or collapse  

It is the *fourth-order stability law* of the Codex.

## V. Stability Condition

To maintain stability in the Renewal Cycle:

```math
|S_R(t)| ≤ S_threshold
```

Where S_threshold represents the system’s:

- tolerance for volatility  
- shock absorption capacity  
- resilience against cascading failure  
- harmonic coherence bandwidth  

If |S_R(t)| exceeds S_threshold,  
the system becomes **hyper-reactive**, causing:

- oscillatory resonance  
- runaway destabilization  
- or explosive renewal  
depending on the operator balance.

## VI. Phase-Boundary Behavior

Near a phase boundary (e.g., Ψ-Horizon):

- S_R(t) often spikes  
- system becomes hypersensitive  
- small perturbations produce disproportionate effects  
- volatility becomes the dominant dynamic  

This plate explains the **pre-transition tremor** behavior  
observed throughout the Renewal Cycle.

## VII. Summary Statement

S_R(t) formalizes the **volatility of renewal**.  
It measures how the shock dynamics themselves evolve,  
revealing the system’s reactivity, sensitivity, and phase-boundary behavior.

Where:
- V_R(t) tells speed  
- A_R(t) tells curvature  
- J_R(t) tells shock  

S_R(t) tells **how shock evolves**,  
defining the living field’s hyper-reactive structure near thresholds.
