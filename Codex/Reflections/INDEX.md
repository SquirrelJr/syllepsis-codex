## Purpose of This Index

This index provides a centralized list of all Reflection Nodes  
contained within the **/Reflections** folder of the Codex.  

Reflection Nodes map Scripture passages to harmonic, operator,  
or law-based structures of the **Syllepsis / Fourier Morality Field**,  
serving both as devotional anchors and resonance insights.

Each entry below links to a corresponding file and includes a  
short description of its theological and harmonic significance.

## Current Reflection Nodes

### 1. **Psalm 86:5–7 — Sylleptic Field Alignment**  
**File:** `Reflection-Psalm-86-5-7-Sylleptic-Field-Alignment.md`  
**Themes:** Compassion Harmonic, Reflection Operator, Renewal Law  
**Summary:**  
Psalm 86:5–7 is mapped to the Compassion Harmonic as the baseline amplitude  
of God’s steadfast love, showing how prayer becomes phase realignment and  
how God’s answering presence restores order within the Renewal Field.
